ixikai6,t3_z2vsit,"A few rights that women have and men lack are: 
  
* Presumed custody of children in the case of divorce. This was exacerbated by the Tender Years Doctrine, spearheaded by first-wave feminist Caroline Norton, and perpetuated by modern feminists through lobbying groups' efforts against rebuttable presumed shared custody. 
  
* Seperation of consent to sex from consent to parenthood and the responsibilities thereof. Feminist commentators have said that a unilaterally male-controlled contraceptive would ""take away womens' choices"". 
  
* Bodily integrity (i.e., genital mutilation. For girls its a violation of international law; for men it's at best unusual but tolerable, and at worst actively campaigned for as an eroneous means of combating AIDS). Feminists, while claiming to be advocates for ""equality"", are curiously quiet on this issue, compared to their efforts on FGM.  
  
*  Immunity from accusations of rape. Rape requires the perpetrator to have a penis, so when women engage in nonconsentual sex with men, he is more likely to be charged than she is. This is mainly the work of Feminist researcher Mary Koss, from whom feminists get the eroneous 1-in-4 statistic. And if a woman gets pregnant from raping a man (or boy), she can sue her rape victim for child support.
  
Obviously some of these would be best reformed by giving men rights (bodily integrity, for instance), while some would be better served by removing womens' privileges (immunity from accusations of rape). Equal treatment, that's all that's required.

While a good portion of the wealthiest people are male, please keep in mind that they represent the minority of men as a whole. 

Men are disproportionately affected by homelessness and often are excluded from shelters in favor of their female counterparts. 

Some men have to work in terrible conditions where there is risk of death in order to provide for their families.

Boys have been falling behind in education for the past 30 years increasing the number of school dropouts.

Men are disproportionately affected by the number of suicides, with being the lack of support for men's mental health being one of the main causes.

In most countries men are the only ones forced to stay if a war starts.

Child custody cases tend to be heavily against men.

Male victims of sexual assault are barely ever taken seriously.

The issue I see with feminism is that they tend to create a narrative in which men are in position of power most of the time while most of them don't even have control of their lives. It also doesn't help that the loudest portion of feminists (not necessarily the majority) have been known for shutting down conferences in which men's mental health is discussed.

ixiol8f,t3_z2vsit,">Also, why do you all disagree with feminism because isn't feminism just about people being equal?

Feminism has never been about equality. Thats just a slogan. There has never been a feminist talking point that wasn't specifically about giving rights and privileges to women. Most of these points could be gender neutral but never are. Its never about reducing violence its about reducing violence against women. Its never about increasing wages its about increasing wages for women. Its never about reducing homelessness its about reducing homelessness for women. Its never about raising college graduation percentages its about raising them for women. Its never about more rights for all its about more rights for women.

The concept of feminism for equality is absolute nonsense. Go into *absolutely any* feminist space. Literally any you can find, anywhere. And talk about equality and equal rights for men and women. You will not be allowed to remain there long.

I am completely serious. Try talking in any public feminist space about any of the talking points available from this subreddit about issues affecting Men. Take your time, find one you agree with that you think is a real problem that needs attention. There are many it shouldn't be hard to find one you can relate to/find worthy of attention. Then speak about this issue amongst Feminist. Find out **exactly** how much they are about equality very quickly.

But maybe don't do it on your main account. Because you'll be banned, instantly. And don't do it amongst your friends. Because you run a *very high* risk of losing those friends.",t3_z2vsit
ixiq5kl,t3_z2vsit,"Firstly, and this is important..  
**""FEMINISM != WOMEN""**

Just because we disagree with or feel hatred towards feminists who have pushed for / successfully enacted laws / polices / models which negatively affect men that does not mean we hate women.

Secondly, Many MRA's acknowledge that there are areas / systems which negatively affect woman (Roe V Wade being repealed for example) and many of us are pro women having rights.

Thirdly, Feminism is **NOT** ""About people being equal"" as you claim.  
If it was, then there would be no need for Men's Rights to exist because, ""Being equal"" Feminism would be looking at and pushing for issues affecting men to get ""**EQUAL**"" treatment / resources as issues affecting women.

But that simply is not the case at all and when you bring this up most feminists will either say ""Feminism isn't for men!"" or ""Go make your own movement like we did!""  
But of course because our movement doesn't follow feminist dogma nor does it view issues men face through the lens of feminism we ultimately get criticized for ""Doing it wrong""

Next, Feminism is full of double standards.  
Feminists will push and lobby for more 'gender neutral' terms / descriptions when those terms / descriptions don't benefit women.. but will then use gender based descriptions against men.

As an example, feminists pushed for job titles to be changed to be more gender neutral:

Fireman -> Firefighter  
Policeman -> Police Officer  
Chairman -> Chair Person (or just Chair)

Because the according to them: ""The original titles implied that they were jobs that were only suitable / doable by men""

Now, to be fair I don't actually have a problem with this as it makes things more inclusive..  
However feminists continue to use gendered terms like:

Mansplaining  
Manspreading  
Manterrupting  
And the biggest one: Toxic Masculinity.

These are all terms commonly used by feminists. These terms also **EXCLUSIVELY** imply that they are things that **ONLY** apply to men.

See the double standard here yet?

Finally, my major issue with feminism is how they allowed a bunch of feminists (Without any training / background in psychology or therapy etc) to develop a model of domestic violence known as the Duluth Model of Domestic Violence.

This model was built based upon biases and assumed conclusions rather than any actual facts / evidence. The model also **ASSUMES** that in all cases of domestic violence involving a man and a woman the man is **ALWAYS** the aggressor while the woman is **ALWAYS** the victim.

This has led to the exclusion of male victims of domestic violence from the statistics and has also led to the societal notion that ""Men can't be victims of domestic violence""  
The funny thing is, one of the creators of the Duluth Model came forward to admit this and despite this there has been **NO** effort or movement from feminists to repeal this faulty and useless model and have it replaced with a model that is based on facts, evidence and reality.

Feminists also lobbied very hard to have the definition of 'rape' specifically imply that the criminal must have a penis.  
Ergo, in most countries, 'Rape' is a crime only men can commit where as when a woman rapes a man it is instead labeled as ""Unwanted sexual contact / connection"" and does not carry the same seriousness / stigma as 'rape' does.

These are the reasons why I am anti-feminist because these examples prove that feminism does not give a single shit about men or being fair towards men.",t3_z2vsit
ixiwufy,t3_z2vsit,"You sound young.

By now you have probably worked out that men have at least 3 concrete human rights FEWER than women:

* FGM is illegal, MGM is legal
* Men have no reproductive rights at all (it's actually assault if he stops her from getting pregnant against his will)
* Men have no parental rights - they are based solely on the word of the mother, if if that word is an outright lie

In the USA, men lack a further right: men MUST register for ""selective service"" (i.e. the draft) but women do not have to. This was originally the duty bestowed upon men who gained the concurrent right to vote. Now, women can vote, but with no duty to serve their country.

So these are human rights that men don't have.

There are well over 100 ""privileges"" that women get in society that most women are utterly unaware of, and men do not get at all. These range from serious: the de-facto assumption that women are incapable of doing harm to men (and that men are almost incapable of NOT doing harm to women); to not serious at all: women get free entry to clubs, men never do.

The statistical definition of rape is controlled by feminists. Feminists actively block acknowledgment of males being heterosexual rape victims, support services for them, and laws to protect raped men and boys.

For statistical reporting, rape has been carefully defined as forced *penetration of the victim* in most of the world. Please listen to this feminist professor Mary P Koss explain that a woman raping a man isn't rape. Hear her explain in her own voice just a few years ago - https://clyp.it/uckbtczn.  I encourage you to listen to what she is saying.  (Really.  Listen to it! Think about it from a man's perspective.)

She is considered the foremost expert on sexual violence in the US.  **She is the one that started the 1 in 4 American college women is sexually assaulted myth by counting all sorts of things the ""victims"" didn't.**  A man misinterpreting a situation going in for a kiss and then backing off when she pulls back, puts up her hand, or turns her cheek is counted as a sexual assault on a woman even if she doesn't think it was.  **As you hear in her own words the woman's studies professor and trusted expert that literally wrote the book on measuring prevalence of sexual violence does not call a woman drugging and riding a man bareback rape ... or even label it sexual assault ... it is merely ""unwanted contact""** 

You see she has been saying this for decades **and** was instrumental in creating the methodologies most (including the US and many other government agencies around the world) use for gathering rape statistics.  E.g. 

Detecting the Scope of Rape : A Review of Prevalence Research Methods. Author: Mary P. Koss. Journal of Interpersonal Violence Volume: 8 Issue: 2 Dated: (**June 1993**) Page: 206

> > > Although consideration of male victims is within the scope of the legal statutes, **it is important to restrict the term rape to instances where male victims were penetrated by offenders. It is inappropriate to consider as a rape victim a man who engages in unwanted sexual intercourse with a woman.**

Src: http://boysmeneducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Koss-1993-Detecting-the-Scope-of-Rape-a-review-of-prevalence-research-methods-see-p.-206-last-paragraph.pdf

She is an advisor to the CDC, FBI, Congress, and researchers around the world and promoting the idea that men cannot be raped by women.  There **was** a proposal to explicitly include forced envelopment in the latest FBI update to the definition of rape but after a closed door meeting with her and N.O.W. lobbiests, it mysteriously disappeared.  She has many many followers and fellow researchers that follow her methodology and quote her studies.  That is where most people get the idea rape is just a man on woman crime.  Men are fairly rarely penetrated and it is almost always by another man.

Most people talking about sexual violence refer to the ""rape"" (penetrated) numbers as influenced by Mary Koss's methodologies, but in the US the CDC also gathered the data for ""made to penetrate"" (enveloped) in the 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2015 NISVS studies.

As an example lets look at the 2011 survey numbers:
https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6308a1.htm

> **an estimated 1.6% of women (or approximately 1.9 million women) were raped in the 12 months before taking the survey**

and

> The case count for men reporting rape in the preceding 12 months was too small to produce a statistically reliable prevalence estimate.

vs

> **an estimated 1.7% of men were made to penetrate a perpetrator in the 12 months preceding the survey**

and 

> Characteristics of Sexual Violence Perpetrators
**For female rape victims, an estimated 99.0% had only male perpetrators**. In addition, an estimated 94.7% of female victims of sexual violence other than rape had only male perpetrators. For male victims, the sex of the perpetrator varied by the type of sexual violence experienced. **The majority of male rape victims (an estimated 79.3%) had only male perpetrators**. For three of the **other forms of sexual violence, a majority of male victims had only female perpetrators: being made to penetrate (an estimated 82.6%)**, sexual coercion (an estimated 80.0%),

[NISVS 2010](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs_report2010-a.pdf) showed in the past 12 months, 1.1% of men were made to penetrate and 1.1% of women were raped. Table 2.1 & 2.2 on pages 18/19.

[NISVS 2011](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/ss/ss6308.pdf) showed  in the past 12 months, 1.7% of men were made to penetrate & 1.6% of women were raped. Table 1 on page 5.

[NISVS 2012](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf) showed in the past 12 months, 1.7% of men were made to penetrate & 1.0% of women were raped. Table A.1 & A.5 on pages 217/222.

[NISVS 2015](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/2015data-brief508.pdf) showed in the past 12 months, 0.7% of men were made to penetrate & 1.2% of women were raped. Table 1 & 2 on pages 15/16.

Varies a bit from year to year, but pretty even overall. In both cases the four year annual percentages add up to five. The numbers for perpetrators vary a little from year to year too. Something like 79-84% of made to penetrate (nonconsensual envelopment) victims are victimized by women. Something like 96-99% of rape (nonconsensual penetration) victims are victimized by men. So in the 2010s, it averages out that a typical year has ~60% men & ~40% women as perpetrators of nonconsensual sex outside prisons rather than the 99:1 ratio discussed.

But since made to penetrate is not rape, the narrative is that men are rapists and women are victims and boys/men that are victims are victims of men. Therefore most of the gender studies folks create programs to teach men not to rape (e.g. /r/science/comments/3rmapx/science_ama_series_im_laura_salazar_associate/).  Therefore there is justification for having gendered rape support services which means almost none for males victimized by females.  **These misleading stats are ammo to tell men to shut up about rape because 1 in 5 women are raped vs ""only"" 1 in 71 men** and dismiss raped men because men are one group ""nearly all the men were raped by other men"" so somehow raped men are to blame because they are men...

If you don't like CDC data: 

Scientific American: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sexual-victimization-by-women-is-more-common-than-previously-known

*A recent study of youth found, strikingly, that females comprise 48 percent of those who self-reported committing rape or attempted rape at age 18-19.*

The Atlantic:
https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/11/the-understudied-female-sexual-predator/503492/

*a 2014 study of 284 men and boys in college and high school found that 43 percent reported being sexually coerced, with the majority of coercive incidents resulting in unwanted sexual intercourse. Of them, 95 percent reported only female perpetrators.*

and 

*National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions found in a sample of 43,000 adults little difference in the sex of self-reported sexual perpetrators. Of those who affirmed that they had ‘ever forced someone to have sex with you against their will,' 43.6 percent were female and 56.4 percent were male.”*

Time:
http://time.com/3393442/cdc-rape-numbers

*when asked about experiences in the last 12 months, men reported being “made to penetrate”—either by physical force or due to intoxication—at virtually the same rates as women reported rape (both 1.1 percent in 2010, and 1.7 and 1.6 respectively in 2011).*

Just maybe, rape isn't a gendered issue and we should stop treating it like one.  But if we acknowledge that, then we would have to point the blame at ""rapists"", rather than ""men"".

Isn't just the US.  

Feminists lobbied against gender neutral rape laws in India, so women are not rapists and men victimized by women are not rape victims. https://www.timesofindia.com/india/Activists-join-chorus-against-gender-neutral-rape-laws/articleshow/18840879.cms

So a woman physically forcing sex on a man is not a rape in India, but a man breaking an engagement after having sex with his fiancee is a rape.

Israeli feminists were concerned if a woman raping a man was recognized by law, a man could threaten to make false accusations against the woman after the man raped her in order to keep her from reporting. Apparently false accusations are a problem for women, so they fixed this by blocking the legislation that would have made rape a gender neutral crime.

https://m.jpost.com/Israel/Womens-groups-Cancel-law-charging-women-with-rape

Nepal feminists also blocked legislation there ...

> Women's rights activists had criticised the draft ordinance saying it wasn't empathetic towards the plight of the victims. They said that having a provision saying even men could be victims of rape could could further weaken the women rape victims' fight for justice.

Mind you, I wasn't even arguing or speaking up about Men's Rights (at the time). I was only *questioning* some of the main Feminist's talking points and concepts because they seemed radicalized and hypocritical to me.

It all came to a head when I first saw The Red Pill movie and was presented *for the first time* with real research and constructive thinking about the Feminist movement and its ideologies. When I tried speaking with my friends about the movie, some of them were horrified and others were actually offended. The few that weren't immediately put off by the fact I didn't hate the movie refused to actually watch it. I would try speaking with them about the issues brought up in the film and they would literally shut down, unwilling or unable to think critically of Feminism. One of them told me ""Everyone I know considers themselves a Feminist, why are you doing this?"". When I started actually bringing up counter-points against Feminist concepts they had an intervention because they thought I was joining a Nazi Hate Group. I'm not joking.

The entire experience was harrowing because it was when I first realized how much Feminism resembles a cult. It is actively and aggressively confrontational with any outside thinking or questioning of its tenets. It discourages people from looking too closely at its presented literature or statistics. And it has very strict rules about engaging with anyone outside of its own members. When you tell a Feminist that you aren't a Feminist they look at you like you are a Satanic Cultist. Which is something I've only even seen with religious fanaticism.

Since then I have looked closer and closer and the more I dig the worse it gets. I feel like you might be experiencing this concept for the first time given your reactions to other posts on here. Its very important to know that most of us here very much support women's rights and the concept of equality. We just don't think it should come at the expense of men's rights.

80% of all consumer spending is controlled by women.

Women are seen by the legal system as innocent victims (of men) who can't do anything wrong, but if they did, it was a man's fault. But contrast, men are seen as unable to do anything right, but if they did, it was because a woman made them.

This leads naturally to a legal system in which women are given favorable treatment. Women are 60% less likely to be arrested, charged, kept in custody awaiting trial, convicted, given custodial sentences, and serve those sentences to the full. This in turn partially leads to the imbalance of male/female prisoners, making it look like women can't do anything wrong (confirming the first assumption!).

Women are just as likely to perpetrate domestic violence (actually, women are responsible for 70% of one-way domestic violence - i.e. she hit him, he didn't hit back) but women are almost universally not prosecuted for it, for much the same reason as above.

Women are seen as the default caretakers of children, despite being responsible for 90% of infanticide, 60% of which is moms killing boys. Women kill children at 10x the rate that men do, but they are automatically given custody!

Women (as a societal group) never pay as much tax money as they receive from governments, meaning that ""free tampons"" are actually paid for by men, not women. Why should men pay for women's monthlies?

In the UK, there are 1500+ domestic violence/rape crisis centres for women, but NONE for men.

Partially this is because, by definition, men can't be raped by women. No matter that a woman holds a gun to his head and makes him enter her, this forcible sex act against his will is not considered rape, and she will not get a rape conviction. He has nowhere to go for counselling, and will be directed to (I kid you not...) ANGER MANAGEMENT COUNSELLING!

In case you were thinking that rape of men by women is a rare thing, it isn't: [http://time.com/37337/nearly-half-of-young-men-say-theyve-had-unwanted-sex/](http://time.com/37337/nearly-half-of-young-men-say-theyve-had-unwanted-sex/)

This leads to children being forced to pay child support to their adult rapist: [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/09/02/statutory-rape-victim-child-support/14953965/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/09/02/statutory-rape-victim-child-support/14953965/)

...but only if the victim was a boy and the rapist was a woman.

...

The list just keeps going. At the end of the list are various benign things such as women being given bus seats, given free gifts, given flowers (ask any man you know when the last time he was given flowers....), free entry to clubs, the empathy gap, and much more.",t3_z2vsit

No matter how good a movement starts out, it will eventually be controlled by people who desire the most control. Weaponizing the emotions of women has been extremely successful as men make great scapegoats due to rarely being able or willing to keep up with the levels of manipulation that these types of women are using. If you speak up for me a rights, you are a misogynist. That has been remarkably easy to maintain as gospel, because men typically resort to silence and stoicism during adversity. You are asking why the quiet kid doesn't inform the class about what it's like to be bullied. Most already know, but don't want to also be bullied so remain quiet. Those in a position to stop things have no need since they aren't bullied. Some of those even benefit from the bullying. While toxic men can physically overpower a woman for control, men are virtually powerless if a psychotic woman wants to destroy his life. Women at least have the police and gov funded shelters to escape. If men don't make a rock solid case with video evidence of abuse while never making any mistakes such as insults that could be “emotional abuse” that would justify her physical violence, he will have to go through hell to even get a restraining order.

It's incredibly toxic. Especially because there's been a HUGE push to get more women into game development by radical leftists/feminists, which in turn also attracts radical leftist/feminist women. Almost to a fault, if you look up these female devs on social media, their bios are FILLED with major red flags... ""feminism"", ""communist"", pronouns, ""BLM"", LGBTQ flags, etc etc.

I've been in male dominated fields my ENTIRE life, ranging from blue collar jobs to white collar jobs. I've seen it all & yet I've never seen men act even remotely in the way that these mass-hysterical ""sexual harassment at work"" media hitpieces would suggest. I honestly don't believe ANY of it.

Blizzard being a perfect example... you can say what you want about Blizzard being awful. Fair enough. But the ""misogyny"" claims were fucking ludicrous beyond comprehension... literally saying that men come in drunk at work & that the women have to do all the work in their stead... yeah, as if the 10% of the team who's female (if even that) somehow is able to take on 100% of the workload. What a load of bullshit. Or all this garbage about how the bosses ""excuse"" that drunk behavior from the men because ""haha, boys club amirite"" (I'm not exaggerating this, these were literally the things said by female workers at Blizzard) & how all the women were degraded & humiliated at work. It's laughably extreme, like OTT ""Handmaid's Tale"" level extreme. Like it reads from a feminist oppression porn book about the horrors of ""patriarchal oppression at work"". It's such a joke.

In this context, there is controversy over whether such sex-based differences in the variability of intelligence exist, and if so, whether they are caused by genetic differences, environmental conditioning, or a mixture of both.

When I asked her about how we were supposed to finance kinds and a larger appartement, she had no plan. I asked her if after having children she planned to come back to work... she didn't know. It was clear she was expecting me to pay for everything.

We broke after some time.  Since then I'm having the time of my life.( and she quickly found a dude to pay the bills... but that is none of my business)",t3_z2zzqw
ixm3ug1,t3_z2zzqw,"I work in a somewhat stressful job; my senior colleague has had 3 strokes during work itself that I know of so far. I can't describe it fully due to privacy reasons but in a nutshell our department is on a 24 hour lookout for stuffs and events in market, i.e., even if I clock out, I still have to be responsible for a team in the night shift if something happens that concerns our job. And then, you have the women ""colleagues"" who are never made liable or responsible for anything by HR or the senior managers. For them the job ends dot at 1800hrs and no one takes official calls after that or during weekends even if it's an emergency. I have two women in our team but due to HR policy, they can never be given night shifts due to ""security concerns"" and ""employee safety policies"".

And I am supposed to believe in the ""equality"", ""empowerment"" and other bull-craps, the HR forces and continuous subtle degradation we have to face as if we, the men who do all the hard work and fill in for them are all predators and only they can keep us under control on leash.",t3_z2zzqw
ixk3i0z,t3_z2zzqw,"I would argue that there is nothing necessarily wrong with a man going to work and a woman staying home managing the house and the kids, except what ends up happening is ""keeping up with the Joneses"".

The media and advertising prey on women's fears and anxieties.  The basic message is ""if you don't use our product, you are a bad mum"". That drives a desire to consume more and more, which means that the man has to earn more and more. To earn more, men either work longer hours to get more pay, or put themselves in more dangerous situations to get ""danger money"". I would challenge any man here to go through his expenses from last years and divide the spend into common spend (eg groceries etc), his spend, and her spend. I would suggest that the overwhelming majority of the spend was keeping her happy. Yes, you both went on that trip to Bali, but you would have been just as happy with a camping holiday and skipped the day massage.

We need to put ourselves first, our kids second, our wife third, our parents/siblings/cousins/friend etc fourth. One of the things us men are very bad at putting ourselves first.  I have a simple rule. If a mate contacts me and says ""hey, I'm up your way, want a coffee"" I stop work and catch up.  That annoying client will still be there in an hour or so, but maybe my mate wants me to brighten his day up because he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer and needs to tell someone discretely (yes, has happened), perhaps it's another mate who is having marital problems and needs some advice (yes, happened a number of times) or someone who is about to top himself and wants to say goodbye (yes, sadly has happened and I helped him)

Men are excellent at putting ourselves last as we are trained that way from childhood. Men, put yourself first and especially your mental health.  If you are not catching up with at least one mate per month for a coffee/beer/meal, or just a chat, then start doing it.  Busting your guts so your wife can tell Mrs Jones she has a better model SUV actually disrespects you. Sure, when you die and the $1M life insurance comes through for her, she can finally get that liposuction she wanted and get that Gucci bag she wanted, but did you really want to be her doormat?",t3_z2zzqw
ixjiee4,t3_z2zzqw,"This is a very well-written and compelling story. It reminds me of the times I've used the description: ""Arbeit Macht Fleisch"" (a word play on the infamous German phrase: ""Arbeit Macht Frei""), to describe how I see so many men – family, friends, coworkers, acquaintances, etc – being ground down and fed like fleshy fuel into an uncaring, all-consuming machine, composed of many parts, but with one of the largest pieces of that convoluted apparatus proudly bearing the name: ""Gynocentrism"".

I wonder if the ""simpler times/roles"" narrative you describe – referencing *Bewitched* and the like – is all that relevant to the general ""contentedness"" of previous generations. I actually see communication as the key component, whether it occurs in a relationship where one or both people work, or any configuration really.

However...and this is a big however, I would have to agree that – in the current era – the ability for two people in a relationship to communicate at all is damaged to the point that it no longer exists to any significant degree. People can't just be themselves, and live their lives as an individual anymore. Instead, many men get treated as if they are a group of men, and it makes it impossible to even communicate reasonably with someone else. Comments like ""men never share their feelings"", or ""men never help out around the house"", are basically a death knell for a successful partnership if you ever hear them spoken. And the problem is that those kinds of attitudes are encouraged these days, which is making it impossible for mutual understanding to happen.

Women definitely have a much better (state sponsored) support system post marriage with respect to financial benefits and the services provided to them.

Listening and not judging is always rewarding, and should be prioritized to fixing problems, that comes later and when is appropriate, not just because. I think helping men to be more humane and sensible, and stop saying mean things like all men are so and so which is by definition false and discriminatory like all generalizations. And teaching ignorant women that female chauvinism is just like trying to extinguish fire using alcohol, and is not the solution to male chauvinism. Also I was raised by male chauvinistic women grandmother and mother, and that also is something to be addressed since I'm gay and that was harmful to me growing in such a toxic environment, and even if I wasn't and I was straight male chauvinism is so toxic. What can a male chauvinistic man can look for if not a male chauvinistic woman as spouse to act out all his madness during decades or until she dies of cancer (my family story, psychosomatic illnesses).

If we can't accept that men do have more violent tendencies as a trend then the only ""fix,"" that's going to build any real traction is bullshit revolving around toxic masculinity and ""teach men x,"" rather than actually addressing the roots of the problem like the empathy gap or gynocentric education systems.

I think the core misunderstanding with your argument, though, is conflating DV with generalized violence. Violence in general is a tool to gain power. DV is directed at a specific person - or perhaps more accurately a specific role - whereas general violence is directed at a more faceless concept which could be any number of things, but would generally be some societal factor.

Denying the tendency of men as a class to be more violent subsequently denies the existence of factors and circumstances men are subjected to which would predispose them to violent tendencies. Doing so allows less empathetic ideologies to have full narrative control.",t3_z351o9

the thing imo is outlet, like when a person is pushed, talked down to, yelled at, not taken seriously…when there is something missing in the needs pyramid ppl lash out… women lash out too but it's less likely to be physical, less likely u will see the aftermath (bruises etc.)

after a certain point it boils over (not just for men) and any sort of violence can occur

what we should focus on is finding out a way to live and coexist better, with more understanding about ourselves and others (idk if its a common case but i tend to ignore myself most of the time, just numb and distract myself whenever i can… then it can boil over sadly, i know its bad but its hard to change, i try to isolate when i feel like blowing up so i dont hurt someone with words or worse tho)

i sincerely for women to feel safe outside, on the train, in public, even alone among other things

and i sincerely wish for men to find out how to care about our emotions (those we gladly ignore), to learn about ourselves and to cry without feeling guilty

If you call a woman a girl, you're insulting her ""womanhood"". If you call a girl a  woman, you're calling her old. So women want to be called women and girls want to be called girls, and heaven help you if you fuck up. So what do we do instead of playing their shitty little mind games?

 >Penis envy (German: Penisneid) is a stage theorized by Sigmund Freud regarding female psychosexual development, in which young girls experience anxiety upon realization that they do not have a penis. Freud considered this realization a defining moment in a series of transitions toward a mature female sexuality. In Freudian theory, the penis envy stage begins the transition from an attachment to the mother to competition with the mother for the attention, recognition and affection of the father. The parallel reaction of a boy's realization that women do not have a penis is castration anxiety.

The fact you're even trying to compare the n word to calling women ""girl"" is absolutely hilarious and delusional.

Additionally, women also score higher than men on related measures not designed specifically to measure the Big Five, such as indices of anxiety (Feingold, 1994) and low self-esteem (Kling et al., 1999).

In Morocco, the divorce rate used to be really low….why? Because women weren't allowed to initiate divorce. So, women were forced to endure shitty marriages. Then, Morocco decided to give women the right to divorce and the divorce rate skyrocketed. Why? Because they had an avenue to get out of their shitty marriage. 

Child support laws allow women to leave a bad situation. Some people may abuse it but that's not the norm. For far too long women who were being abused did not have an avenue out of that situation and just had to endure it.

Another aspect is the unequal division of labor. Most women are having to work a 9-5 and also have to do majority of the domestic responsibilities…on top being going through pregnancy and child birth. The reason most are choosing to work on top of of everything is so they don't put themselves in a vulnerable position where they do not have a financial means of getting out of an abusive relationship….Since having kids and maintaining a home doesn't pay at all.",t3_z3ah17

You need to learn a bit more.  Women in the 1950's were not “property”.  They weren't even “property” during the age of Coverture either!  

Women could get divorces pre-no fault divorce in the same basis as men.  They could get divorces on infidelity alone - assuming they could provide evidence.  Stuff like cruelty etc were *additional* grounds for divorce *in their own right*.  

I am glad you at least acknowledge that women getting custody is a result of feminist activism though, whilst Jezebel and “Big Red” seem to think it's “Patriarchy”!  

But what really is your point.  Past generations of women (and you're going back centuries or more by the looks of it, not to our grandparents' generation) had it bad, so that means everything today is OK?  By that logic, because the Barbary Corsairs used to raid France's Mediterranean coast for slaves, it was fine for the French to rule Algeria regardless what the locals thought about it.  Or black murderers and rapists in America shouldn't be punished because their ancestors were slaves, or bigotry by people of Northern European ancestry towards people of Italian background is fine because the Roman's invaded Northern Europe and kept many of them as slaves?  

That's the level you're actually on about.  Is there any woman living who was even alive when the Married Woman's Property Act was passed?  The answer is NO!  

Injustice 150 years ago does not justify injustice today surely!  Or are you really seeking female supremacy?

Men and boys can be raped by both men and women:

Definition of rape from 34 U.S. Code § 30309 - Definitions

> rape
> (9) Rape The term “rape” means— (A) the carnal knowledge, oral sodomy, sexual assault with an object, or sexual fondling of a person, forcibly or against that person's will; (B) the carnal knowledge, oral sodomy, sexual assault with an object, or sexual fondling of a person not forcibly or against the person's will, where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of his or her youth or his or her temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity; or (C) the carnal knowledge, oral sodomy, sexual assault with an object, or sexual fondling of a person achieved through the exploitation of the fear or threat of physical violence or bodily injury.

ixlgmae,t1_ixleixt,"Thank you so much for such a heartfelt response I hope you're doing better mentally wise, there are many free things you can do to improve your life. Like prayer, as far you know let's say “the prayer of the lord” you have a tool to exercise forgiveness and to use it for giving thanks to God. Thanking God is not about having many things is just an act of selflessness and love that makes you feel better and I'm sure it can help with being healthier too (how psychology affects immunology). Stoicism has helped me a lot and is poverty friendly in terms of mindset for example it says “Very little is needed to make a happy life”, or “If the mind is willing the body can go on without much”. Some famous Stoics philosophers were poor and such noble and respectable men they were. I respect you and I hope this can be useful for you too. You are as human as I am and anyone else is, never less but equal in how valuable you are, and remember “Is always too soon for lies and never too late for the truth”. Best regards.

Edit: one of the first things I've healed forgiving were depression and anxiety forgiving my abusive father (psychological abuse). There are many ways to forgiveness and prayer perhaps can be yours, and I think even when you don't believe in God, even then as far as your prayer is honest and genuine, it can help you.

Zelensky told all the women to leave the country.
And men 18-60 to stay and fight.
How does a 60 YO man fights better than a 25 YO female?
I m 56, work with several young females as delivery drivers.
They are faster than me and can lift as much.
In these days of equality, i just don't get it.
Further thinking on the matter.
So if Zelensky would have told women up to 30 YO they were drafted (Not pregnant women).
If men are stronger ( We are stronger when it suits remember, but not when it does not suit), can't we put the men to the front and the drafted women helping the war effort?
Preparing good meals, tending to the wounded, bringing to the front whatever is needed, help civilians in liberated villages and so on.. 
This would actually free men that do these tasks to fight the Russians.
But “No!”, draft the women and everyone would have raised hell!

When we actually divorced I had my attorney show me the law.  It said that if someone is in professional school and the earning party is paying tuition, on divorce you owe back the amount of tuition you paid.

ixpzbqb,t1_ixnbq6e,"Well 2 concerns I see of people in this sub:

""Unfair"" terms

It can be thrown out if deemed ""unfair"", which is vague and 100% up to interpretation by the judge.... ""Oh, you owned this house before you married? Well because she's a single mom with a kid by another man, it's unfair that she didn't get the house. So I'm throwing out this prenup""

And the kicker:

Unconscionable Terms

A prenuptial agreement can be ruled unconscionable and invalidated if its terms clearly favor one party, or are so unfair that one party would face severe financial hardship, while the other prospered.

EG: Your prenuptial is voided because the woman you married was in college before marriage, but dropped out to be a stay at home mom to a wealthy business man, all by her own desire, and therefore a judge decides to invalidate the whole prenup, based on one agreement of no alimony.

All of these listed, of course, can go both ways. Prenuptials don't really hold weight if the judge has biases, or other things end up at play... They are a terribly weak legal document.

There's also the fact that, a prenuptial can't prevent a guy from getting baby trapped, which makes them even more useless for a man.",t3_z3lshv

ixq1i2u,t1_ixq0fwr,"Yes, that is the legal term. ""Unfair Terms"" and it is open ended and up for interpretation by the judge.

That is the term to use of you go looking for cases of prenuptials getting thrown out for said reason. I'm personally not going to go digging through Court paperwork to find cases of it being used that way, because there are more than enough legal help websites outlying it as a reason, for me to have little faith a prenup can be sound, and I would not really know where too look for public divorce cases....


And yes, it would be my sole decision to leave school to be a stay at home mom, as a woman, period end of story. If I were to agree alimony was off the table by signing the prenup, I should be held be held to that agreement, or not agree to it.",t3_z3lshv

Police need to be impartial and not just instruments of the prosecution: not simply taking a scene at face value on the word of someone, or profiling that scene.

He had a patient, a woman who had been in a relationship that seems to be comparable to yours. Only that the roles were reversed, she was a woman and her boyfriend was the suicidal one. Every time she was ""leaving"", either out of town over a weekend, on a holiday or something similar, he took a bunch of pills and then called her mobile. So she had the responsibility to ""rescue"" him. This went on for a couple of times, until one day the battery on her mobile was dead, and his call did not reach her. He died that day, and she was left with the guilt, leading her into a severe depression and therapy.

It was very hard for that woman to recognise what is obvious to an outside observer: It was emotional blackmail, and a form of abuse. That was less a relationship than it was a hostage situation. It would have been OK for her to leave him for good, no matter the consequences.

And here is another thing about suicidal people that is hard to accept for some people, especially suicidal ones: Everybody basically has the freedom to do whatever they like, including killing themselves.

I'm not an overly emotional person, but when a first partner left me because we differed in how we saw the relationship (them just a fling but me more long term), I did things that I would never have done in a rational state of mind (not holding them hostage by threatening to kill myself, but trying to get them to accept my perspective and acting clingy) and it was a shock to me how I was behaving, yet I felt carried along by the emotion. I don't think what I did was any worse than many people do during relationship conflicts and yet it is a milder form of the hostage situation mentioned in this thread, so I can see how someone even more emotional could become more extreme in their response. They aren't doing it deliberately or rationally, but because of the emotional pain they are in. I learned a lot from that experience, particularly that we are not necessarily as in control of our emotions and responses as we would like, especially in a new, unknown situation.

Whilst it isn't someone elses responsibility, it's a bit harsh to simply abandon them to something that is not fully within their control. When I look back on how I was that first time, because it surprised me and I had no prior experience or understanding of what I would experience and how to better handle it at the time and no-one to help me through it.

I wish social services were more available as an option to refer people to for assistance, at many levels of intervention, so that one can extricate oneself from feelings of responsibility. In particular, helping people learn to moderate their emotional impulses at an earlier age and to understand what others are going through, so you can extricate yourself in a more optimal fashion for both sides.

I also struggle with the similar issue of abandoning someone who is ill, because they impede the life you might be having with someone else. Marriage used to contain vows ""in sickness and in health"" and yet today, many people espouse the notion ""if your partner is not meeting your needs and is holding you back, you should leave"" as if you should only be with them for the good times, the benefits.

I suppose its the issue about how selfish should we be when we live in a society based on consideration for others as well as ourselves and not simply self-interest. It should not be a choice between abandonment or having them institutionalised, for example.

Whilst theoretically, everybody has the freedom to do what they like, but with that freedom comes responsibility for your own actions, responsibility for ones actions can be a very grey area when people are consumed by emotion, as they are when consumed by mental illness.

For men, these ideologues might say ""but only 25% of male murder victims are killed by someone they know"", but 1/4 of 80% (which is the total % of people killed who are male) is still 20% of the TOTAL.

In other words, of all people killed ""by someone they know"", men would still be significantly MORE likely to experience that, so by their OWN logic, men are indeed killed ""just because they are men"".

The point is, the reason why women are ""often"" killed by someone they know isn't because that type of violence happens significantly more to women, but because women are killed so rarely by strangers... just as men aren't ""rarely"" killed by ""someone they know"" (and are probably killed more under those circumstances than women to begin with, in terms of absolute numbers), but because men experience violence by strangers so much more, the RATE/RATIOS change drastically. It's extreme cherry-picking just for the sake of pushing a misandrist narrative.

Even women killed by their partners weren't killed ""because"" they are women. That's fucking asinine. That's like saying that every interracial murder is ""because"" of race.

Every man that didn't get life boats on the titanic, every man that's drafted into a war, every man that is picked for a dangerous task because they don't want to put a woman at risk, every man that isn't spared because some maniac has a ""I don't hurt women and children"" moral code, and every man that is brutally beaten by police officers. They were all targets of violence because they are men. 

There is also plenty of gendered violence targeted against men, both in real life and in popular media. Movies and television are full of male henchmen getting killed or beaten, just because they are men. Movies and television feature countless forms of sexual violence against men, or casual threats of sexual violence towards men, including threats of rape, castration or emasculation. The news are full of stories of woman hurting and killing men in their lives, for benign shit that they would have never tried to use as a justification for killing a woman. 

And what's worse is that a lot of these instances that are determined to be ""violence against women, because they are women"" are not actually gendered violence. Not every instance of a man hitting a woman is done ""because she's a woman"" but rather because she was physically weaker. And that's certainly not going into every instance of violence that were reciprocal/mutual or even incited/encouraged by female victims as well.

(prison population is affected by length of sentence, making it even worse than murder convictions)

specifically, look to the intimate partner violence graph on page 8, and the discussion section that discusses how victim services affect ip homicide, and gives some citations that lay down the reasoning for the way that this works; this particular paper is just numbers.

tl;dr: victim services like shelter primarily reduce killings with some defensive component, by giving people who would otherwise feel like killing is their only option another way out.

this means that women's shelters reduce the number of men killed. there is, right now, a considerable gap, but, if men and women have equal access to victim services, as shown by data from the 70s before they were common, the gap shrinks considerably; women are only about 53% of ip homicides. (it fluctuates between 50 and 55%)

See, there I was having an argument with this feminist where I showed that men where far more harshly punished but they claimed that women who murder their partner gets longer sentences (15 years vs 13 or something I think they claimed) , this despite men getting sentenced in all other cases and crimes far harsher, even being punished to death far more often. 

I found this odd and after some thinking theorised that this probably was because of how massively privileged women where. My guess was that any women who did not have overwhelming evidence against that is they planned it out and carried it out with indisputable evidence and doing so in a utterly horrific and public manner where simply found innocent or not punished at all meaning only the most horrific and indisputable of female murderers gets punished and even then they would get milder punishment and only rarely face execution. Meanwhile, men killing women, even accidentally would see them imprisoned and judged a murderer. So men get punished the full range while women only in worst of cases, leaving the impression that women get longer sentences. In reality, they get no sentences or softer where only the ones that would be executed if they where male would be punished. 

So I started reading up on the murder rate per gender googling it I found article after article written by feminists that so my innocent women where in jail for killing their abusers. Looking into this I found that they based this on the fact that nearly all of them claimed that he was abusive (83% I think). Of course, feminists accept all these claims as absolute truth and the man is too death to defend himself. In fact a vast host of evidence shows that women are more violent in relationships than men. I.e. it would seem that these claims are just a get out jail free card for women, and it works! The court believe them and let them of the hook, only the most egregious cases gets them jail time and even then feminists believe them. 

But I was missing the final piece to validate this; the rate of how often women Vs men kill their partner because the murder rate is flawed in that it's based on who is punished for murdering not on who actually murder. I needed to find the kill rather, be it accidental, inadvertently, in self defence or intentionally per gender. If the difference was small I knew I had something.

Well, you could consider domestic violence to be a gendered issue, if the victim was chosen due to being a woman.  This is mostly seen in male domestic abusers, who choose their targets deliberately as they perceive women to be weak, and enjoy hurting them.  This is a gendered motive.  You also see it in female domestic abusers who choose to hurt men, usually out of enjoyment of hurting and humiliating men.  That is selecting your target based on their gender, and is gender violence.   


""Gender-motivated homicides connected with armed conflict or with gangs""  
The gender part is right there in the quote.  We are not talking about any women that is killed as a part of the conflict or gang related behaviour.  We are discussing when women are killed deliberately because they are women.  For example, the killing of women and children in villages during conflicts.  


Most honour killings have female victims.  This is typically seen in areas of the world, where women are killed for bringing ""dishonour"" to their families and are killed for it.  This can be for a whole manner of reasons, such as speaking to a non-related man, having sex outside of marriage, or attempting to flee an abusive husband.   


Regarding trafficking:   
""The 2016 UNODC Global Report disaggregates data on the basis of gender and found that women and girls are usually trafficked for marriage and sexual slavery. Men and boys, however, are trafficked into exploitative labour, including work in the mining sector, as porters, soldiers, and slaves.""

Yes, you could do that, and add all these 11 people to the list of victims of gender-based violence. Or, you could do like UN and count every woman killed by an intimate partner as gender-based. Which makes it a lie.

And when they don't lie, they manipulate and distort. Consider this prominent paragraph, repeated throughout the report (which indidentally does NOT cover gender-based violence toward men, although they claim the data shows ""women most affected"" without ever comparing the two):

""While the overwhelming majority of homicides worldwide are committed against men and boys (81%),
women and girls are disproportionately affected by homicidal violence in the private sphere. Approxi-
mately 56% of all female homicides are committed by intimate partners or other family members, while
only 11% of all male homicides are perpetrated in the private sphere.""

This dataset consists of 81,000 ""femicides"", which means if they are 19% of all homicides, the number of men killed was 426,315. 
- 56% of all women killed, was killed in the private sphere, that is 56% of 81,000 = 45,360. 
- 11% of all men killed, was killed in the privare sphere, that is 11% of 426,315 = 46,894.

The point still stands that the most dangerous place for women is the home.  It is also valid to say that women also experience gendered violence at a disproportional rate, since a large majority of murdered women are murdered because they are women.   


Focusing on women's issues does not mean that male issues do not exist.  If an article does not exist discussing male victims of violence, then that is the issue.  Women still deserve resources to prevent them being killed, despite their deaths being in smaller numbers.  In the countries where honour killings still occur, it is very difficult for women to leave that situation, so need further help.  Women are more likely to be a victim of DV according to current stats, which puts them at higher risk of being killed.   So the resources are needed there too.

""Focusing on women's issues does not mean that male issues do not exist.""
Actually, it does. This is not ""one article"", and you know it.

""It isn't a competition"".
Who's making it into a competition? UN is NOT saying: ""Hey, a lot of women and girls are subjected to violence, let's join in and do someting about it"". They are justifying the focus on women and disregarding of men, by claiming victory in this competition.

Edit: One last point. You say ""If there aren't appropriate resources for men or awareness, then that is the issue."".

It might not be, but it's important to know where best to allocate resources and funding to prevent this, and how best to try save the higher percentage of people.    
If we were somehow able to stamp out murders in the home, that would stop 56% of the murders committed against women.  This would only stop 11% of murders committed against men.

iyclybw,t1_ixsg76g,"The issue is that there is a difference in motive. What works for stopping or at least minimising the number of men killed by family or partners, may not work for stopping women killed by their family or partners. 

Finding the root of the issue is important, and will differ between men and women, between ages of victims, and location in the world. These things are important to establish, so a possible remedy can be found. 

For instance, both men and women can be victims of domestic violence. Both men and women can be killed as a result of the domestic violence.  However, women are more likely to receive serious injuries than men, and are more likely to be killed, if the perpetrator is male. There's also the shocking number of over-killings in female victims of murder in general.  
As they vary in extremity by a large proportion, it's safe to say that the cause and motive are different too. Thus, the remedy will be different too between genders. Right now, they believe it's gender motivated when it comes to more than half of the female killings. 

This is why it is important to allocate research, resources and funding properly. If the issue is gendered, then it's important it is treated as such. The potential cure for these issues could be, and are likely different, depending on the gender of the victim, and the gender of the perpetrator.",t3_z3p1m9
iydyflg,t1_iyclybw,"""it is important to allocate research, resources and funding properly. If the issue is gendered, then it's important it is treated as such.""

Indeed, with emphasis on the IF. But that's not what is happening, is it? There is no investigation here. Feminists just *asserted* many decades ago, based on nothing but their own subjective feelings, that in a nutshell, men use violence to dominate because they hate women, and women only use violence in self defence. Anyone trying to insert *facts* and *scientific observations* into this issue are dismissed, harrassed, ridiculed, defamed and threatened into silence. It is instructive to look at the history of Erin Pizzey, the woman who started the first modern shelters for battered women. She was hounded by feminists for daring to speak about women's own violence, which she found was prevalent. After numerous death threats, deemed credible by the police, including finding her family dog dead on her porch, she eventually left the country and went into hiding. There are still regular bomb threats to venues where she is speaking, to this day.

What the research shows - and have *always* shown - is that domestic violence is NOT gendered when it comes to motives and pathologies. There are some differences in consequences, mainly due to the fact that men are on average 50% physically stronger than women. Although the extent of this difference is hard to judge exactly given the strong taboo around male victimhood and female violence, likely resulting in massive under-reporting.

Organizations such as UN Women never reference gender neutral research in their reports or PR-/lobby campaigns. That's instructive in itself. If what they're claiming is really true, why would they not want to provide evidence? Instead the rely on manipulation, such as in this report we're commenting right now. They assert that women are killed because of their gender, more often than men. But there is nothing to back it up.",t3_z3p1m9

It doesn't bother me. It's basically entertainment. I've seen their worst. You have to realize something when you read TwoX: the overwhelming majority of the content there is fake.

* The open letters. Oh god, the open letters are so stupid. Every story should be punctuated with ""and then everybody clapped"" at the end.

* The situations about them giving verbal beatdowns to men.

* The claims about incel culture on reddit. ""Reddit loves watching women get beat up I saw it in a video on the front page!"" As it turns out, it's a video of a woman hitting a man, usually several times, and then him hitting her back. Their brains accepted a woman hitting a man as acceptable, and they only got offended when he defended himself.

 * The claims that the posters there received ""rape and death threats"" after a post, usually edited in. You see, it's funny because I've had fake accounts where I posted shit on TwoX that would get upvoted. I got tens of thousands of upvotes, posting bad things about men (easy upvotes there), and I didn't get a single piece of hatemail. Odd how their posts with 200~ or so get ""dozens.""

Remember, TwoX posters once sent themselves rape and death threats to try and get the subreddit off the default list.

Any of us who choose to be the calm, reasoned and logical voice to their blind bigotry will be hated and belittled. I am not saying it is easy or pleasent, but if we ignore the subreddit the echo chamber only grows louder.

Precisely because an examples of people that do not adhere to the vicious stereotype they set up cause immense cognitive dissonance. It makes it extremely difficult for a person focusing on being hateful to maintain their hatred of men when men don't present themselves as anything other than likable.

When women see that men aren't presenting themselves as superior, or trying to put them down to feel superior, it makes it harder to maintain the narrative. Sure they will ban folks and try to get more yikes... but if you stay the course of being wholesome and not positioning yourself further from them, it makes them look yikes to newcomers, and makes them feel yikes when they see their vitriol pushed in men's faces without any form of provocation.",t3_z3ro71

> It's a shame that the two groups cannot find common ground due to the extremists. Often their issues do go hand in hand, and require numbers to achieve them. 

I get what you're saying and I absolutely agree, but I think that both sides (though on my very biased opinion more so the other (feminist) side) are inherently going to be at odds due to the very nature of the core values of each side. Common ground is simply not the objective for either party, even though it will in the end be required for progress on societal issues. What's important is that each side does their best in what they stand for WITHOUT putting down the other side. Extremists just put down the other side more than most.

ixnsk5d,t3_z3ugt8,"From the article:

> In 2014, Sweden launched ""feminist foreign policy"" to much fanfare. Intended to examine gendered problems and responses, and strengthen foreign policy decisions by centering women's and girls' perspectives, realities and challenges, the approach appeared promising. Other countries followed suit: Canada, Luxembourg, France, Mexico, Spain, Libya, Germany and as recently as September 2022, Colombia.

> On Oct. 18, 2022, Sweden abruptly abandoned this approach, with the new government calling the ""feminist"" label counterproductive.

> Today, there is still no consensus on how to define feminist foreign policy. There are no cross-country comparisons of impact. Differing interpretations have resulted in frictions between governments and civil society. Aside from conceptual difficulties and uncertain impact on foreign policy, we posit that feminist foreign policy has four deep flaws that greatly limit its potential.

> In a 2020 survey about Canada's Feminist International Assistance Policy, more than 50 percent of respondents believed feminism, gender equality and/or programs on women's empowerment did not benefit women and instead undermined men and boys.

This [BBC article](https://web.archive.org/web/20221019124841/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-63311743) about the topic has the following quote:

> But the Swedish Gender Equality Minister Paulina Brandberg, from the Liberal party which has previously supported a ""feminist foreign policy"", said that ""so long"" as she remains in post she will ""make sure the government's policies are feminist"".

The liberal party is part of the current right wing government that supposedly (?) 'ditched' the feminist foreign policy.

### Questions I'd like to discuss:

- Do you think this will be more of a 'rebranding' aka ditching the label or is there going to be a genuine shift to be more inclusive and fair with respect to contents?

- Do you think that the 'intersectional' approach the writers of the article propose has merit or is it going to be just a facade?",t3_z3ugt8
ixoxizj,t1_ixnsk5d,"This is using language to disguise the ideology. I would say they have doubled down on ideology at the same time.

Intersectionality is about *intersecting systems of oppression.* That comes with preconceived ideas about who is oppressed or the oppressor.  In practice that means accepting that men are privileged over women and men's problems are not of equal consideration as women's problems.

In this worldview, 'fairness' means helping the 'oppressed'. 

If you look at international development, feminists, like UN women,  have changed to include men more in their thinking. They went from 'women in development' to 'gander in development' to 'gender mainstreamnig'. But the reason for that change is not to benefit men, but because the earlier interventions where not effective at helping women.

Now they include men in order to prevent backlash. They  figured out that sweeping into a impoverished community and just listening to women and helping women caused resentment among the men. Now they give lip service to men's issues and try to explain to men how empowering women will benefit them.

None of the gender mainstreaming  documents I've read gives serious attention to men's issues. They don't see men as deserving of care and attention in themselves. There's a few nice words about how men need attention, but that is contradicted by the other 90% of the document is about women.",t3_z3ugt8

ixpfotj,t3_z3wxpu,"Well as a general rule. Online dating is pointless and self defeating.

With this woman you are seeing, you can love her and be together with her without merging your finances with hers if that's your concern.

The question is surely is she the woman for you or not? And if you feel a need to protect your weath that is understandable. But a long term relationship probably shouldn't be dictated by her level of wealth, as long as you take measures to protect your own.

And with you ex, do not go back in any way, keep her away from you. You know what she is, she will baby trap you or something else if given the chance, if you just use her for cheap sex and then she gets her hooks into you again, well then that's your fault at this stage.

A woman can go around dating apps writing her requirements, financial and physical, and it's seen as normal. I used to think that they must be really willing to put effort into dating if they require so much, but that's not the case.

I've seen women who wrote which profession a man must be employed in to date her, others who've listed which professions they wouldn't date, the minimum salary requirements, must own house and luxury car, and what not. And would you like to guess how much effort they'll put into dating? Zero. 

They'll sign up on some dating app, swipe on profiles and that's all. Most don't read bio, almost none text first, and many won't even put efforts to keep the conversation going. It's all on you. The same repeats on dates. I don't think the end result in most cases really worth all the time, effort and money that you'll spend on her.

I don't date anymore because I have enough FWBs, but when I used to, I had a simple strategy: sleep and see. That is, have sex first and see where it goes. Don't waste a lot of time and effort before that.

ixqcd3m,t3_z3wxpu,"The purpose of dating was originally to see if both people were compatible enough for a long term committed relationship, assuming that's what both wanted as its what society encouraged to grow the population and economy.

Underlying this is biology which is designed to perpetuate the species through procreation by giving men a sex drive and women a drive to have children (both have sexual pleasure as an added inducement and both are drugged by nature to ensure they stay together long enough for procreation to be successful).

Society has yet come to grips with the reality that sex, procreation and financial support are each separate things and should not be combined or made dependent on each other.

Society needs procreation to perpetuate the species, so society needs to pay, not just Fathers. For the benefit of the child, both parents need to be committed to procreation and access, regardless of financial considerations. Sex, beyond the requirements of procreation, is a separate thing where people should be allowed flexibility, but its an important and powerful aspect of life that should be facilitated by society, not left to chance or simply to procreation. Sexuality is such a powerful influence in life, men and women should not be casually thrown together as there will inevitably be consequences from the mating game on both sides that will lead to worse outcomes.

It's tragic that society still requires Fathers only to financially support procreation whilst not being guaranteed any benefits, only responsibilities for 20 years, and being criminalised for expressing their biological sex drive based on how attractive a woman finds them: women aren't criminalised for expressing their biological drive to have children, based on how attractive men find them and they are not held financially responsible for bringing a child into the world, despite them being the only ones with that power and choice; men have no choices, only responsibilities.

Objectives have become lost and the processes originally meeting those objectives now pointless including dating. Society needs to address the future and how to optimise the objectives, now that biology is no longer the only objective and higher order outcomes, such as choice by both men and women, are becoming important.",t3_z3wxpu

I made a comment in ask men when asked about this, here is the difference between US women and other women when it comes to dating (dating specifically, just gotta reiterate).  So as someone not from the US who lives here now and has for a while, here is how I would sum up women:

American woman:  How much does he make, what does he do, he can't live at home, he must do X, Y, Z, how tall is he, X hobby will DQ him, what can he do for me -- gives next to no gifts or gestures, relationships are al about women, and create drama from nothing

Most other women (save England and Australia): Is he kind, would he be a good family man, does he just work at all (they rarely give a shit what a man does)  -- lots of gestures to show they love their man, very role responsible relationships, single motherhood is not viewed as a trophy, blames next to nothing on sex/gender

US women stick out like a sore thumb in the dating world to me compared to other women of the world.  They are the ones doing everything different.

And here's a shocker: the woman will have to pay you too. 

In brief, there's no such thing as unpaid sex. All sex are paid. The sooner you and other men realize it, the better. I'm not making this up. I'm planning on writing a detailed article about this and post it here for all to learn from.

And The reason you compare escorts/prostitutes with buying a bag of chips is mainly because you don't have to play the pre-sex romance game with 99% of escorts. And because you don't play that game, you don't feel like you earned something. And because you don't feel like you earned something, the whole exercise seems cheap to you. 

Let me give you an example. Imagine you are playing a video game such as Grand Theft Auto 5. The first time you played it, it took you 40 gruelling hours to finish, and only then you felt satisfied. It was tough, you died many times but eventually won the game. 

Now imagine you were playing it for half an hour and it said: ""Game over. You win"". Would you feel satisfied? Nope. 

You can simulate this game with escorts very easily, except for the fact that this time it will be safe as you will be playing it in a secure, sandboxed environment. Your income, assets, reputation, pension etc won't be touched. And there will be little to no possibility of false rape, DV and SA accusations.

Almost completely burned out on Marvel shows, and I used to be a MASSIVE superhero nerd. It's not because I don't still like that kind of stuff; it's because of the woke.

And I did not even look in the direction of Wakanda Forever. I barely even process the reviews. When I say the movie is dead to me, that's not projecting; it's acknowledging something that happened before I even noticed it. And a few years ago I would have been fanboying over it and counting the days before it hit theaters.

It's just... yeah. Marvel lost a lifetime fan over stuff like this. And it wasn't even a conscious decision, I've just been burned too often by them.

It's cross-fertilizing, too. I didn't bother with the new hobbit show either.

What the reviewer in OP's quote doesn't realize, is that I personally never even got to the 'incel date' plotline. The show was so bad that I didn't even get more than an episode and a half into it. It was unwatchable. At all. So the point they're trying to make about 'lol incels don't like justice' is just... completely tone deaf.",t3_z3y9vo

And this is right off the bat and not getting into how they completely ignored he originals personality because it wasn't stunning and brave enough..

I'm not saying that there _weren't_ some dumb fucks who gave it bad ratings for no other reason then to be cockpleasers- but that isn't _why_ the show is so hated.. and to act like all its bad rep comes from that or (like the woman who made the ludicrous post I'm referencing) because men are frothing at the mouth watching a male _villain character_ being punished while the hero woman prevails is just.. it goes beyond disingenuous, especially when you learn that the entire _goal_ of the show was to be hated.",t3_z3y9vo

It's the same with the “female Doctor”.  The mentality that insists on “gender swapping” an established character (at least they had more justification here than for Thor) typically produces s#it storylines.  And whilst David Tennent is back briefly, they're race flipping the Doctor next.  And the same s#it writing will have the same poor result for that iteration too.  And the result?  It's not their cr@p storylines and $hit characterisation and poor dialogue.  No!  It's because the audience is “racist” or “sexist”.  Can't possibly be because they've no idea beyond some “woke” gesture!

Wrong. It's also convenient for feminists to claim that isn't it? Feminism framed rape as being a ""male on female"" crime, which is why women cannot be charged of raping men on a federal level as the other guy correctly pointed out. You can look up the FBI's definition for rape which by default excludes all male victims of female rapists. Feminists are the ones who wrote those standards & if you want to know how far the blatant misandrist feminist corruption goes, educate yourself on Mary P. Koss' work. A world-leading & renown feminist academic who \*literally\* said that men cannot be raped by women & that men who are drugged by female offenders & are forced into sex aren't ""rape"" victims, but merely experienced ""unwanted sexual contact"": [https://soundcloud.com/889-wers/male-rape](https://soundcloud.com/889-wers/male-rape)

Feminists then use these gendered definitions that deliberately exclude male victims to conduct their sexual violence reports & then conclude with ""SEE??? 99% of rapists are men! 99% of victims are WOMEN! Clearly rape is a male on female crime!!!""

Yeah no shit, if you're not using gender neutral methodology, then you're going to get extreme outcomes. It's circular reasoning & deliberate self-delusion on a mass scale, all because you misandrist cultists are so fucking desperate for rape being a ""pressing issue"" (at least for women specifically) in order to justify your own existence.

Then when you're called out on your man-hating bullshit, you ALL - without fault - blame the non-existent """"""patriarchy"""""" for men not being included in national reports, blatantly ignoring how feminists were the ones behind those criterea. Amazing.

But more importantly, when you actually look at the CDC's NISVS 2010 summary report, which was widely cited by feminists at the time, if you gender neutralize the data, then men made up... 50% of ALL forced sex (aka ""rape"") victims over the 12 month period. In regards to all other forms of sexual violence, men made up 46% of the total. Important to note that the VAST majority of male victims had FEMALE abusers.

Take a second to step outside yourself and see perspective from the kids point of view. They're in a pretty shit situation based on decisions being made by both parties. They didn't choose that, it's the hand being dealt to them. Two, you can't change biology, kid is your blood, you contributed 50% to making em when you made the decision to have sex. That doesn't make this insignificant just because of the natural consequence following sex. Three, contraceptives are never risk free, if you were that worried about getting pregnant as a couple then why not take on some of the responsibility to stop it, like male birth control if you think you're lady isn't taking theirs properly. Real equality has prevention from both sides. Four, more on the biology side, similar to how men will always be stronger than women, women will always have the womb to bear children. We don't decide how our species came to fruition nor the components each person has so stop being butt hurt that it's reality. This is equally said to any women bitching about men being stronger and taking away opportunities from them. Biology cannot be a factor in rate of opportunity as it's not a changeable influence but a constant. Five, taking a step back to what is actually being debated here... Right to make decisions about ones personal body vs. right to make decisions about ones personal finances. In my opinion the ""right"" that people refer to doesn't exist. The government can go into your accounts and freeze them or force you to pay stuff, or downright just take your money and line their pockets. The government can also change laws that take away access to abortions, people come up and do whatever they want regardless of your personal space, when you get older or just live with mental health your independence and right just ""naturally"" gets taken away the more crazy you go, from putting you to bed at 6 to controlling where you take your person and what you do with it even if you're still mentally sound. Looking at another angle, consequence of not having your body respected or your finances respected. Finances rule the world, you can't do anything without money, which is why researchers are naming financial stability as being before the importance of shelter and food. Not having your body respected, right to choose if you want to have a baby, to consent to others touching you medically and intimately, etc. Time and time again we are taught oppression is bad and freedom is the only way.  So it would seem to me that not having the right to both would be detrimental. The inevitable impasse, of which my partner and I thought up a potential plan. However like any theory, kinks not fully worked out. 
Plan:
Currently in my country most abortion clinics will not abort past roughly 3-4 months depending on location. You can only abort past this date for serious medical reasons such as death if not aborting. The government doesn't let you abort beyond 5 months 6 days for safety risks to the carrier. 
Assuming this law is still in effect, the following is proposed,
Couple gets pregnant, they have 3 months to decide if they want to have the child. If any party chooses to opt out of all financial responsibility they have to do so before 3 months. Opting out of financial responsibility also opts you out of being a parent. In other words you give up parental rights and so are not allowed to change your mind years later when you suddenly want a relationship with your long lost child. If both parties opt out, abortion occurs. If guy opts out but girl chooses to keep, she is 100% responsible for said child. If girl opts out, guy chooses to keep, he is 100% responsible for said child. Now, in this case the guy who chooses to keep child would have to pay for all medical birth related costs and healthcare. This includes cost of ""renting said womb"" till child is born. To get estimates for this it would fall in line with surrogate expenses, roughly $33-44,000+. I am aware of the argument of women not wanting to be pregnant and the psychological strain should one be forced to carry to term. Well a couple counters, you made the decision to have sex and you got pregnant, makes you responsible. Same argument of contraception, take it better next time. I do believe though there needs to be limitations, such as risk of health if mother can't carry to term medically, substantial disruption of life that would either make you exempt from carrying or qualify for financial compensation if resulting in lost income. Basically an argument of what would be more detrimental would ensue and least harmful path chosen. If they both keep well clearly no problem. If they are past the 3 months mark and forgot to declare opting in or out, then both parties are each 50% financially responsible.",t3_z47hbz

Seems they both had protecting. 

My thing is what if she cheated on him and got pregnant and was forcing this baby on him knowing he was getting into s good future in doing things? 

The fact that he had to run for making a decision to protect his way of life and have a longer life span is crazy to say the lease. I saw some people said it was the woman's decision regardless what the guy/ man decided and she had the right to bring the child in the world even if he  didn't want it is out right evil. 


Having the right to bring a child into this world should be everyone right woman or man if they feel they can take care of it but taking a child's life after a certain period should also be really considered because it's wrong in of itself because you just never know. 

Woman fail to understand it's not just about them or the child but about the father as well because it has longterm effects mentally emotionally and physically also deep psychological implications for s child's development and any and all negative environment can have impact said child on a level that can do more harm than good.

No one should bring up a child in a poor environment where said child does not have 3 meals a day able to read and write and learn and become the best they can be in life. 

To force a man to take the Financial burden to raise kids is wrong if he does not want to same should be said for women as well. 

A lot of women I know have done just that have kids with men because they see how nice the mixture of the kids will look and then leave the guy because they feel they can find better.  And then they stay single and everyone is like omg look at the poor thing she is all alone let's help her she made that choice herself because she didn't want to be with anyone just wanted kids to put her own ideas into their heads.

It seems to me that the woman is the irresponsible party in this scenario. Any parent worth their carbon would agree with parenting is a multifaceted process that involves full cooperation from every entity involved in order to make successful humans.

The way things go is, if a woman puts your name on the birth certificate then as far as the government is concerned **YOU** are responsible for that child.  
They don't give a shit if you aren't 'ready' to be a parent.. The government does not want to pay for children and so will force men to do it for them.

Take your white knighting bullshit out of here..

What actually happened here is: **BOTH** parties agreed to use protection to avoid pregnancy before both sides were 'ready' to raise a child. **BOTH** sides had sex and the birth control / protections failed.

**ONE** side reneged on their agreement and decided they were 'ready' regardless of what the other side said and simply expected the man to fall in line and acquiesce to their demands.

I would agree that it was murder, if the abortion that was to take place was super duper late term. At the point were it is no longer a fetus, but an unborn baby. This however, this abortion could have been performed within a few days of the conception, so it really would've only been a clump of stem cells yet to be specialized into organ tissues and muscle tissues that was aborted. 

Again, you could consider even that as murder as you may consider that as a life, I dont however. 

Sex used to exist for the purpose of making babies exclusively, but no longer. You've to understand, humans have changed some fundamental rules of nature with sapience and the freedom available to most of them. We do shit all the time with no direct incentive towards the species' survival. This doesnt exclude sex for pleasure. 

And I do believe that if you take every precaution, get dealt a bad hand, then betrayed by your partner? You deserve some leniency in the responsibility department.

If ""Sex exists for the purpose of making babies"" then human's like other animals would have heat cycles and would only be 'fertile' at certain times of the year like other animal species are.

But that's not the case so I guess sex isn't ""Just for making babies""

Also, fuck right off.. If I consent to sex and my partner does not disclose that they have herpes, or aids or some other sexually transmitted infection that doesn't automatically mean I consented to contracting that infection.

ixpryba,t1_ixpqia2,"The issue of abortion is always going to be fundamentally hostile because even though you are being respectful in this discussion, I can not just say ""agree to disagree"" or whatever. A ""clump of cells"" early in a pregnancy is still a growing human being with its own unique dna, and dehumanizing that growing baby is so vile to me, especially taken into account that people use that as an excuse to justify abortion. From the perspective of someone who genuinely believes that a fetus is not a human, I could understand why abortion wouldn't seem wrong, but believing that a fetus is not a human is just simply not true.

And I just want to clarify, I'm not religious at all. I'm entirely secular, even possibly considered antitheistic, so I very much believe in the science when it comes to this. Can a fetus or embryo or ""clump of cells"" survive independently? No, but neither can newborns or coma patients, etc. Are they yet capable of conscious thought? No, but keyword ""yet"". Given just a few months, that fetus will have fully functioning circulatory, respiratory, and nervous systoms. From the moment of conception, it has its own dna, and is therefore its own entity, no matter how underdeveloped.

I don't want to ramble on because this isn't the place for a debate about abortion, and I don't care for debates either way. I'm just saying that there are only two reasons for believing something that is wrong - either ignorance or malice. And abortion is an issue that you can't just simply have an opinion on. There are real implications for whichever the correct answer is, so here's another way to look at it if you will - worst case scenerio for one side, parents have to take responsibility as parents while the worst case scenario for the other side is literally killing babies. The choice is pretty easy to me.",t3_z47hbz
ixpu5nr,t1_ixpsvt6,"Please, do tell what the other natural purpose for intercourse is other than procreation.

I said, and I quote, ""Consenting to sex is also consenting to any **known** risks"". Obviously you're not at fault if your partner doesn't disclose an STD to you, but everybody who is old enough to make babies should be aware of how it's done. You can't claim ignorance to get out of that.

Consenting to pregnancy is not something you can do. It's just simply not a thing. It's not like ordering a package. You get pregnant by having sex, so if you consent to sex, you consent to the risk of pregnancy. Here's an example for you: Let's say you're going to the beach to sunbathe. Lauing out in the sun is inherently going to run the risk of getting sunburnt. You can use sunscreen to minimize the risk of getting a sunburn, but you're still choosing to lay in the sun despite the risk. And no, you can not just deny consent for the sun to burn you. That is a natural process that is not influenced by what you want it to do.

And finally, as I have already said, I am secular. Not religious at all. If you want some more background, my brother and I were both born premature to a single agnostic mother who wasn't even in college yet. My father is Christian, but he wasn't a very big influence on my life, and if anything, I resent him. My mother, on the other hand went to college broke with two kids at 19 and got her masters degree in science. So yeah, raised by a science-oriented agnostic mother, I would not call myself religious. Oh yeah, and my brother was born 3 months premature and is now 20 and completely healthy.

Using that 'logic' anytime a man masturbates and does **NOT** ejaculate inside a woman he is committing mass genocide given how many sperm are contained within the average man's ejaculation.

Just saying...

Believe it or not, Dolphins have been observed having sex without the intention of 'procreating'  
Sex is something that people find enjoyable and thus its not unrealistic for people to want to have sex because they enjoy it.

Consenting to pregnancy is **ABSOLUTELY** something we as a species have not only the capacity to do, but also the ability to do.  
First step is to use birth control (Like the pill, condoms etc) but yes, sadly just like anything in this world nothing is 100% preventable.

But if a man and a woman who had sex, used every form of birth control they had access to with the express intent of **NOT** getting pregnant. Then why should we as a society force them to continue with the pregnancy and force them into becoming parents if they have already decided they aren't ready?

Look, I get that you have your story about how your religious father was a massive hypocrite and left your mother to raise you and your brother. Very sad and kudos to her for succeeding..  
I also get from your comments that you are anti-abortion Which is fine, you are allowed to have an opinion which differs from mine and other people.

But I conversely am pro choice and believe that its not right or 'moral' for men / women who are not ready (Be it emotionally, financially etc) to have a kid(s) to be forced into doing that exact thing.  
In my mind, an early term abortion (around 9 - 12 weeks) is a point where the lump of cells is still only 'potentially' a new life.

Once again I understand that some people think / believe that ""Life begins at conception"" and once again they are fine to have this opinion, but that's all it is, an opinion **NOT** fact.  
And to me I don't agree with that opinion.  
But I **DO** get annoyed with the pro-lifers who push for abortions to be banned and for women to bare children they aren't ready for and will fight for the ""Unborn child's rights"" right up until the child is born.. then they ghost both the child and the mother and no longer care what happens to them.

You can look at the conversation between me and the OP for more insights. I will say I wasn't giving my life story, just background on how I was raised to reinforce that I am secular. Most of what I said was more about my parents than myself. As for a few of the real points:

Sperm is just half of the fathers dna, unlike the unique and complete dna of a fetus, so no, masturbation and abortion are not comparable.

Yes, I am aware that dolphins have sex for fun. They also rape other dolphins, other aquatic animals, and if humans if presented the opportunity. The point is that recreational sex is not the evolutionary purpose for sex. We weren't given the tools for the job to play with them but because they have an actual use they are intended for.

To clarify, you can not consent to pregnancy because pregnancy is a byproduct of sex which is what you consent to. It's not like the baby can ask permission to begin developing or anything like that. Like in my example, you can't just not consent to getting sunburnt because sunburn is a byproduct of sunbathing which you are consenting to doing.

All else I have to say to this is the same thing I said to OP - a topic like this isn't just something you can have different opinions on. If Hitler said Jews weren't human so they're okay to kill, that's not justifiable just becaue it's his opinion. To a pro life person, abortion is murder, no matter which way you slice it. It's impossible to live comfortably in a world where murdering children is accepted and commonly practiced. There's just no getting around that inherent difference in views.

Oh also, I absolutely share your resentment of religious people, and I think they give pro life such a bad name. The fact that you automatically assumed I was religious because I am pro life proves my point. And then the irony of it that conservatives don't care what happens to the child after it's born. I personally am an advocate of fixing the adoption and foster care systems as well as financial aid for struggling parents, better sex education, and easier access, especially for teenagers, to get contraceptives. There was nothing more conflicting than being a pro life teenager who wanted to have sex while simultaneously not feeling ready to be a father mentally, financially, all of the above.

I mentioned to him that the anti-male propaganda begins earlier than that. 

When my twins, boy & girl, were around 7 years old I noticed that they had stopped watching the Disney Channel live-action TV shows. When I asked them why they told me that they didn't like the way the shows portrayed fathers as stupid, people to make fun of, etc. So, they decided, because those shows disrespected men, to not watch them anymore. 

I was proud and impressed that they were able to see what was happening and to take action. But, what about all of the other children who consume this misandrist content? How are they being negatively effected by those images? What would the reaction be if there were similar programs for children and adults but the attributes were switched so the man is more attractive than the woman, he has constant zingers that point out her lack of intelligence, abilities & physical characteristics, and their children have no respect for her?

You can argue that _he's_ the one who came inside her, and _he_ consented to having sex, so _he_ should be responsible here, but he only consented to sex under the understanding that _were_ something to happen, like it did, then the child would be aborted; the girlfriend then goes ahead and completely ignores that once she gets pregnant.

For example, if you look at statistics of how many people sold weed for a living pre and post legalization in a legalized place, you will find a similar gap, not because people didn't sell weed, but because you can't expect people to admit to a crime. 

And as you said, correlation is not causation. Many other factors such as societies changing view on the scientific and legal definitions of a person as well as the shift in how much religious extremism exists now vs then, there are many reasons that this change could happen, if it happened at all.",t3_z47hbz

I think many people are stuck in thinking about freedom in the sense of ""freedom from"" instead of the more classical ""freedom for""; freedom as simply liberation from obligation as opposed to freedom as opportunity to excel.

Like, who is more ""free"" to play basketball? I, who am not an athlete and have hardly ever picked up a ball, or LeBron James, who had spent nearly his entire life submitting himself to the rigor of practice, training and a rather extensive sive set of rules of the game?

I am more free in the sense I don't spend time practicing, don't have to bother knowing the rules of the game and I'll never have a ref blowing a whistle in my face; but I'm less free in the sense that I can't move the ball down the court in the way he can or score points and avoid fouls.

&#x200B;

The second one is completely wrong, straight-out.  The minor that got raped should not have to see anything having to do with one inkling of ''rEsPoNSiBiLityYY'' for being raped. Period.  Some activist group needs to start a looong campaign to get rid of this.  I don't know why it's even legal - it should be obvious that it doesn't even compute with what is normally legal??  At least to the layman's eye.

&#x200B;

The first one is complicated.  On the one hand, it is completely wrong on a moral level to kill a child for existing just because of how his/her parent went about creating them.  The baby hardly had a choice in that, they aren't responsible, they shouldn't die for it.  

&#x200B;

On the other hand, I - and most pro-lifers - would be pretty happy if abortions were limited but made a rape exception.  Socially it would be more acceptable/palatable to limit abortions but make a rape exception.  And it's less abortion than we have now, which is objectively the goal of most pro-lifers...it just doesn't sit right with some of us because it's still a moral wrong to the killed child, the entire thing we're trying to prevent by opposing abortion.

&#x200B;

I hope I explained well.  Feel free to ask any more questions :)",t3_z47hbz
ixt1810,t1_ixss4hy,"My opinion on rape? I think it's one of the most vile, violent and evil acts one human can perpetrate on another and anyone guilty of rape should feel the full force of the hammer of justice come down on their head. I also believe that the victims of rape have been violated in a way nigh unimaginable and that as a society we should help victims access the resources they need to heal and pursue justice against their attacker including but not limited to medical care (physical and mental), emotional support, legal assistance and financial support for their healthcare and legal pursuits.

I also agree with your intuition, the logic I described above only applies in cases where both parties consent to the act. If you consent to an act, you consent to the possible outcomes. How silly would it sound if someone willingly went down a black diamond ski slope, wiped out, broke their arm and then said ""Wait, I only consented to skiing, not breaking my arm""?

In the case of rape, any rape, there is no consent, so the above logic doesn't apply. This in no way invalidates that if you consent to sex, then you consent to the possible outcomes (pregnancy, STDs, heartbreak, etc).

That said, I can understand why you ask the question since rape is particularly evil and when a child is conceived as a result of rape that can serve to compound the suffering.

I believe abortion kills an innocent human being, which I believe is always morally wrong. Since I believe that, I can't advocate for abortion in cases of rape. I dont believe two wrongs make a right. The child is an innocent party and is not guilty of his/her rapist parents crime. 

Does that mean I think the rape victim should be forever responsible for that child? No, I don't. If the victim is a female, she should be supported with all available medical care throughout her pregnancy, she should be given access to the best mental and emotional treatments we as a society can provide ans she should get justice. She can choose whether adopt the child out or keep the child. Either way, she will have shown a level of heroism in just bringing thay child to term that I would be forever impressed by, regardless what she ultimately decides the best fate for her child is.

If it's a male victim, he should have no obligation to support his attacker in anyway. Should he choose to support the child, I believe he should have that option and I would say he should have the right to sole custody of that child if he chooses. If he instead chooses he doesn't want that responsibility, then like female who adopts her child out, he shouldn't have it.

My guess is you are thinking about the obvious difference between the two: the female has to bear the child for 9 months and the male doesn't. This is true, it's a fact of nature. I strongly doubt there is a way to currently solve this difference adequately, but I'm open to possibilities. Artificial wombs, for instance, may allow a women to immediately transfer an embryo out of her womb moving up the timetable considerably.

Hopefully, if you take anything away from this, it's that I'm not insensitive to the hell that is rape and it's aftermath and that being anti-abortion doesn't mean leaving victims to suffer. This is one of the hardest moral questions our society faces today and my genuine hope is that we can find ways to address such issues without needing to rely on anything that might be murder.

I really disliked the fact that the animation was different - I get that tech has changed, but in-universe it's only been a short time and it's a direct sequel, not a tv spinoff or something. It should've looked the same. Especially because the slightly different animation gave it all a whole different look and atmosphere and feel. It kinda helped it to feel more shallow? 

The fact that the ""mission"" of the movie was the legalization of supers rather than stopping city destruction, society upheaval in the longer run with Syndrome's gear selling plan, and possible further super murder also helped that shallower feeling along too. I liked it and it was a logical next step, but the new animation...kinda didn't help it.

Another thing that helped that was the fact that the Screenslaver (pretty good villain name honestly) wound up not being an actual traditional supervillain - we already had Syndrome to be a not quite average supervillain, so it would have been nice to actually get to see one this time like we heard talk of but never actually appeared. Not that I disliked Evelyn as a villain, but I wish she had been like, an ally of The Screenslaver, working together because they had similar goals and could help each other. As a lone villain by herself, there's too many parallels between Evelyn and Buddy. And if The Screenslaver had been a traditional supervillain ""like the old days"" or even a supervillain *from* the old days come out of retirement because now he has supers to fight again for fun (you cannot tell me that some of the supervillains of the Golden Age didn't think like that), it would have added to the feel that things in the super world could get started again, like how they used to be - were going back to the way they used to be. The new supers fostered this feeling, but I think this would have added to it, in my random person's opinion.

I loved both the concept and the execution of the new supers. I was eating that stuff up pre-release and was not disappointed. They all have sooo much potential. Plus them existing brings interesting questions: did Reflux only recently discover his powers? Do they give him better body? (Come on, he's an old man, with a stomach at that.) If he did recently discover them, that means Helen was waaay off when she though Jack-Jack didn't have any powers because he hadn't shown any yet...as a baby! Presuming babyhood is the most common discovery period for powers and childhood follows, how common is older manifestation/discovery? And Voyd! Is her hair naturally like that? (Personally I prefer her having dyed it to match her new superism, but that's me...) What about Brick? Is she uh...mentally fit to be a super? Not to mention how on earth does she blend in with the general populace. So many questions....

As for the Jack-Jack side plot, it was funny, but I feel it was a tiny bit overplayed. He had...so many new powers. Knocking one or two off I feel would've worked fine.

I totally agree with your points on the story line. There was so much world building done in the first movie that had little to no payoff in the long run. The death of so many supers becoming public knowledge would be a great framework for the return of a former super villain from the old days, since there would be less opposition lurking in the shadows. Further, they could have still done the ""legalize supers"" thing as a side plot, but as the main it fell flat.

Seeing the super world coming back into full swing would be awesome, bring back some old, expand on the new and so forth, but it's success would depend entirely on the studios ability to execute on it and after #2, I don't know if they can, which is a real bummer.

There had to be others that were never targeted and out of the targeted ones, some of those never found, and of the found ones, those that turned the offer down.  Instead the first movie was hardly mentioned at all...something I found rather disappointing.  Not that they had to talk about it a ton, but one or two more mentions would've been nice.

&#x200B;

Haven't seen Monsters, Inc. but I'm all for subtle Pixar cameo crossovers.  Disney cameos in general.  I think it'd be pretty nice if Jack-Jack wound up keeping teleportation (very expansive teleportation) as his power (or one of them) once he grows up.

&#x200B;

Another separate gripe I have is the unholy amount of ''Hevelyn'' (stupid name for an even more stupid ship, Helen/Evelyn) fanfictions that flooded the net.  Helen's a married woman and Evelyn was nice when they were friends but there was nada there.  Also the ridiculous idea that Helen got it with Gazerbeam instead and that's why Jack-Jack has laser eyes...which doesn't work for several reasons, like the fact Jack-Jack has so many other random powers unrelated to either of his parents', and babies normally get random powers before they settle on some, and the fact Helen was very into keeping cover and even Bob, who was most decidedly not, knew nothing about Gazerbeam (who was at their very small wedding) so it makes no sense for Helen to have actually bedded him (cheating...another thing Helen wouldn't do) in the 1-2 years before canon started.  I can hardly blame the movie creators for this though.  It's the fans here.",t3_z47hbz

Even if I'm generous and assume you only meant adult women, your blanket statement would still include raped women. 

Even so, you are avoiding coming right out and saying it so I'll just ask directly. Do you believe girls who were raped should have access to abortion? What about women. 

>It's not moving the goal post, it's understanding the context of the broader conversation

Blanket statements can have repercussions beyond the original context of a statement. That's just English. Pretending otherwise after making the statement is moving the goal post. 

>I doubt they will to, but without me responding, you won't have a conversation. If you want to discuss the validity of adult women choosing to abort their children that result from consensual sexual intercouse, then let's have at it. Otherwise, I'm hopping out since the path you want to pursue isn't the reason I entered the comment thread.

You are avoiding taking about it because you don't believe rape victims should have access to abortion. I'm breaking this off of your original blanket statement, the fact that you ate moving the goal post afterwards, and the fact that you won't state your opinion on the matter. If you believed otherwise, there is no logical reason why you wouldn't state it.

>The analysis explicitly acknowledges self reported statistics are not very helpful and so seeks to design a method based on verifiable data that can be used to estimate the number of illegal abortions being performed that doesnt rely on self-reprted data. The study in the in book ""New Perspectives on Human Abortion"" and is available for free on InternetArchive.

There is no method to accurately produce verifiable data for something that is inherently kept secret. Did you notice that study isn't peer reviewed? I did, and that's why. I specifically tried to find it in a peer reviewed journal and came up empty. Can you prove that the study is recognized as peer reviewed by the scientific community? If their methodology is as sound as you claim it should be easy. 

>Besides your uninformed criticism, you gave heap of alternative explanations for the increase in abortions post-Roe, but you provided no information to suggest that they had a casual link, so it's merely speculation.

Heres a source on abortion rates beyond about the same in places where it's illegal vs legal, though for the same reason as your source i take this one with a grain of salt, it's hard to get accurate date on illegal activity

https://www.guttmacher.org/infographic/2020/abortion-occurs-worldwide-where-it-broadly-legal-and-where-it-restricted

But suddenly women wanted in and sheds found themselves under pressure from women who liked the idea of joining in cosy woodwork sessions with the boys. It's led to a huge split in the movement between those still keen to promote the mateship they believe is vital to encouraging proper support for vulnerable men, and those who prefer to win brownie points from the ladies by embracing inclusiveness

Let's also resist the urge to get self-righteous here, fellas.

People really need to get a grip on this, especially feminists and the regular folks, you can't win an argument when you don't address the actual correct group.  Assuming it's men is a big reason why abortion rights don't really get fixed, too much time is spent going after men for it when men are in the same bucket as women, and virtually no time it spent going after the extreme religious.  Feminists leave the religious and the conservative women alone and allows them to continue on with their mission uninterrupted.

Instead, we have stuff like this, asking a bunch of men who are in the bulk of men who don't even want kids.  I hear the same shit all the time, how men don't wanna be fathers and shit, but yet we want to ban abortion... those two ideas don't mesh, but it's what feminism runs with.

In a woman's abortion, the baby is dead. In the men's abortion, the baby is not. It's detrimental to the baby to not have a fatherly figure when it's growing up as a ton of studies have shown. In my opinion it's worse to straight up kill the baby, yes, but not having that parental figure - especially a father - really screws up you for the long run.

IMO we should all - men and woman - stop finding ways to screw up someone that hasn't been born yet and really take birth control seriously.

2. With Roe overturned, abortion will be banned in many states. If you establish legal paternal surrender as the equivalent to a right that is about to be banned, then how will you be able to make the case that men should have legal paternal surrender on the basis of equality?  
  
3. It's not comparable to abortion. The equivalent to legal paternal surrender is legal maternal surrender. By the way, women have that under safe haven laws, so this avoids the problem of point 2. There is no male equivalent to abortion. There is no medical procedure men can undergo that terminates the pregnancy. SCOTUS has recognized that pregnancy and parenthood are two separate issues.

Especially if the lady can go back and request more later on if the man makes more. I dunno it just feels as though men have less rights in this department than women. Personally I'd have to be their for my kid regardless and I hate that the contractual abortion would mean the kid would have only the mothers income to go off of, but I also hate the reverse idea that if a man wants a baby the woman can choose to just off it. I think this is why I'm for both or neither as well. If I had a kid right now I'd be forced to work 3 jobs and catch overtime at my current one just to cover the child support.  Meaning I'd forfeit my own body autonomy for 18 years. The long hours without break would force me to forfeit my mental and physical health. Personally if it was my responsibility I would, but that's just me. This whole abortion argument hurts my head. I think the safest bet for men is avoid casual sex as much as possible.

The adoption agency is not the problem, it's that women are told abortion is the ONLY option because as you so clearly display, people don't understand how lopsided the numbers are between kids who are waiting for adoption and parents looking to adopt.(kids don't last long in the foster care system) To address your problem, a kid at age six will spend an average of 20 months in foster care before being adopted. source: https://www.focusonthefamily.com/pro-life/foster-care/how-long-do-kids-stay-in-foster-care/   


Birth control doesn't work, as has been shown time and again, not that the pills don't work when you take them, but that the people having unwanted pregnancies simply aren't taking them.

And if all else fails use a condom, they are less than 15 cents. The option exists, abortion is widely available for free with no questions asked, but they still do not take it, they instead use abortion as birth control.

Are women not at all responsible for the men that they let inside them?

There would be just as much stopping that man, as there currently is stopping a woman having a bunch of unprotected sex and using various methods of killing the newly created genetically unique life form to avoid taking responsibility for it. 

That's equality. If women want men to be responsible for the child, they can woman up and assume the _equal_ level of responsibility for a new life. 

If we want more people acting more responsibly with their sexual actions, we can push for and expect it _equally_

The reality of the situation is that women have been freed from their gender expectations and responsibilities, as much as they possibly can be without biological intervention to literally grow the fetus outside the body entirely, and _men_ are already 30% of the way done completing that (on lambs, so far, last I checked)!

And men are still rigidly and violently held to their own. The gap for sex in prisons is the largest there is, demographically. Beats race out by 2-3x. And that's normalizing for the same crime and having received a conviction, which is even less likely on average, almost everywhere. 

There is a _intense_ and often _polar opposite_ treatment of men and women in many situations, conveniently just about always defaulting to “men take the responsibility”.

As for women having a bunch of unprotected sex and aborting, um… outside of the morning after pill, a woman isn't even going to know she's pregnant until she misses a period. I mean, a pregnant woman can't get more pregnant so once she is it's kinda irrelevant how much unprotected sex she has. So figure it takes 4-6wks to even know, hypothetically, a man could screw 10 women a day for those 4-6wks, get them all pregnant, and walk on every child? …and before you say that couldn't happen, sure it could. 

As for equality, sorry to be harsh, and yeah, your gonna say it's a choice I made but, here goes anyway, my husband has fathered 4 daughters and ya know what's changed for him physically? Not a damn thing. Ya know what changed for him when I was pregnant? Not a damn thing. Ya know what issues he has with his body now from having children? None. If we had gotten divorced and he had to pay support he'd have been done long ago. Me, not so much. I still bear the issues of having birthed a child. So please stop acting like sending a monthly check and actually carrying the child are anywhere near the same thing. There's nothing equal about paying a bill vs actually carrying and caring for another human being. They aren't even close. 

…and how are women growing the fetus outside their bodies outside of having a surrogate? Even if it was, without a surrogate, do you have any idea at all how invasive and dangerous it is to harvest a women's eggs? Plus all the health problems that can arise after the process up to and including infertility? Yeah, just another body altering cake walk for women. 

So yeah, there can't ever be true equality, especially when it comes to procreation. Unless men are suddenly gonna start bearing children it's biologically impossible.

Luckily, though, I married someone who could handle being an equal with me and living up to his responsibilities. 

As for the rest, I'm simply stating the facts that men seem to like to overlook. That where procreation is concerned they bear no risk and no responsibility if they choose to walk.

As for your pipe dream of artificial wombs, you still need a woman for the egg. Then men will be complaining that they have to shell out, what was the figure I saw, between $5000-$10,000 for a single egg? Then there would be the cost of using the artificial womb. Considering surrogacy can cost up to $100,000+ I can only imagine what the fee would be to basically do IVF without the woman and then 9 months of specialized in facility care to care for the “womb”. Then there would be all the bills associated with a delivery and your gonna need a full time someone to care for the child, and you think child support is raping men.

However, paradoxically, I have experienced a decline in safety in gay clubs and other spaces recently. I believe that this is because I think people can no longer identify basic sex-categories anymore, and therefore think that there are no boundaries in life anymore and they can just do whatever, wherever, whenever.

ixtn6ax,t3_z4e3x2,"When Roe V Wade was overturned there were a lot of women saying that consent to sex isn't consent to motherhood. However for a man consent to sex is consent to fatherhood. Men can get raped by women and still have to pay child support for a kid they didn't consent to making. This also applies to women who rape boys who are minors. Men can get their condoms stolen and it can be used to inseminate the woman and then the women can sue the man for child support. Even if the man was clear about not wanting to have kids he would still be forced into fatherhood. 

Women have also said that if you have no uterus then you should have no say on abortion even if it were to be your kid. If a woman got raped by a man then she has ways to not be a mother such as the morning after pill, abortion, safe haven, or adoption if she was forced to give birth if she wouldn't be able to get an abortion. There are ways for them not to become mothers. However if a boy or man gets raped then they will be forced to be a father even though they never consented to sex. 

Also, because of the way the laws around rape are written in some parts of the world, if a woman forced herself onto a man then it would be considered sexual assault and not rape because for it to be rape the perpetrator has to have a penis and legally envelopment of the penis isn't considered rape. This is a very sexist definition in my opinion and means that women can't rape men. I think that there should be a gender neutral definition of rape so legally men can rape men and women, and women can rape men and women.",t3_z4e3x2

no, rights are not natural; they are a social construct given to you by those in political office and/or the judiciary and which change from time and place. for example, a person did not have a right to abort a fetus in America 1972 but then had a right to in 1973, then it changed again in 2022. meanwhile if you look at the history of abortion law in the UK it's very different but i don't want to write an essay on this; hope you catch my drift. 

>2) Are some natural and some privileges? If so, which are which? 

none are natural as rights are a social construct altho humans universally have certain desires, namely freedom and well-being. what freedom and well-being means legally differs tho across time and place.

>3) Can one person's rights ever supercede over another individuals? If so, under what circumstances would this be moral? 

yes it can and has to because it's impossible to please everyone all the time. in any civil trial person A will have certain rights that need protecting and person B will have rights that need protecting; whose rights wins out must be decided by an independent third party then, namely a judge or jury, who make a decision based on a combination of legal precedent and their own morals. it has to be this way; otherwise we'd just have war.",t3_z4e3x2

ixwen89,t3_z4e3x2,"Rights are guarantees and entitlements that the group gives the individual. Without the group enforcing rights, they don't exist. When you are alone on an island, there are no rights, because there is no one there to enforce them.

When you are part of a group, you do your duty, and in doing so, you enforce the rights of the others, and earn your own rights, enforced by the others doing their duty.

Which mean what rights are enforced for whom and to what degree is decided by the group. And all of this is in constant reevaluation renegotiation. Privileges are just rights, that are enforced for fewer people within the group. A kings authority rights are a privilege, but this privilege only exists, because all the kings subjects submit to his authority and enforce it as such. And history is full of kings that lost their authority rights, because society as a whole didn't deem it beneficial anymore to grant them those rights.

And that's the reason rights exist in the first place. They are socially enforced, because society/the group deems it beneficial to do so.

The rights of one person superseding the rights of another person happens all the time. When someone wins an auction, that just means the winners property rights supersede the property rights of the other bidders.  
When and how that is allowed to happen, is also determined by the group, as is everything in regards to rights.

There are rights that are more or less equally enforced for everyone in the group. Because those rights are the very basis for forming a group that can enforce rights in the first place.  
The right to bodily autonomy is one of those. Because no one would wanna be part of a group where their own bodily autonomy is not granted. This is a right that can't be enforced more for some than for others, because if that is done, the right ceases to exist as a whole, and the group collapses eating its own.

Apart from that, rights can only be granted to people, to a person. Because a person can have own independent interests that can be enforced socially in the form of rights.

A fetus can't have own independent interests independent of the mother. It's physically impossible to separate the two without destroying the fetus. This means a fetus is not a person and can't have rights. Because the only one that can act in their interest is the mother. No one can take over that responsibility, which means it is impossible to be enforced socially, which means it has nothing to do with rights. There are only the interests of the mother and the interests of the fetus. But the fetus' interests cannot exist independent of the mother's interests, which means the only interests that matter here are those of the mother.",t3_z4e3x2

I assume most men don't because they want the opportunity to have a child later down the road without having some sort of complicated reversal surgery. Likewise, there will likely be more and more states in the future that simply will prevent abortion.

I don't believe abstinence is an acceptable solution for most people.

So really, society needs to work together on this and find a more acceptable compromise and middle ground. Regardless of the agreed upon answer, nobody, man or woman should be forced into parenthood.

ixvs7if,t1_ixucpdp,"Your argument for animal life preservation would require yet another social construct to protect. There are billions of humans who would eat any species of any animal without the construct of laws and punishments to prevent them.  The reason rights didn't exist before a few hundred years ago is that we were still in the stage of humanity where the strongest and most powerful take what they want. We are still largely in that position. Those who are actually in power have done a good job convincing the world that it is actually the hive mind of white men known as the patriarchy who deny everyone else their rights. It's not that the government grants these privileges, but that they have agreed not to impose restrictions on certain behaviors. Your abilities are what you can do. Your privileges are what others don't object to you doing. Your rights are what the government has sworn not to restrict. A woman can say what she wants, that's her right. She most likely cannot perform her own abortion, so she doesn't have that natural ability, but she has the privilege of getting someone else to perform it for her without having to prove she was raped. I agree with that privilege, and wish it were federally extended to a right. My reasoning is that at any stage of the pregnancy, for reasons she should not have to share with anyone, she could no longer be comfortable accepting the risk of giving birth. This is the argument relevant for Roe V Wade, and I get sick of hearing weaker arguments. Modern women believe they are entitled to a child free life regardless of their actions, and that it is by virtue of them being unburdened by a child of their voluntary creation that they should have the right to abort the baby. Not even us mighty white men who control the planet have that right, so that's clearly not how rights are decided. I also don't like the rape argument, because the gov would then ask for a report to be officially filed so that they can investigate the very serious crime that was alleged. Time would be of the essence for the abortion, so that would happen while they investigate the accused person. If it turns out that they weren't raped, but were just really scared of the trauma of childbirth, then they ruin a random guys reputation and livelihood forever. In my opinion, the justified fear of the risks inherent to childbirth are enough to guarantee it as a right. Sometimes people die in childbirth. Some private medical information would let you know which women are at the most risk. No one should be allowed to ask your private medical info. Therefor, the right to an abortion should come from the right to avoid cruel and unusual punishment, ie government compelled childbirth, for the punishment of not using one of the many means of protection. Combine that with the right to medical privacy, aka, you don't have to tell the courts that you are scared because your own mother died during childbirth, or any other private detail that might make your pregnancy an adverse risk.

All that said, I think it's understated in our country that human life is sacred. The goal shouldn't be to have abortions so that you can have a better career and less responsibility. The goal should be to have the option of an abortion as a last resort WHILE doing as much as possible to avoid creating a child that you cannot afford to raise. Feminists are their own worst enemy in this regard by celebrating women who BRAVELY speak out on their decision earlier in life to have an abortion so that they could make millions as a pop star. It conflates rights for entitlement and leverages other women's plights in unavoidable situations such as late term tragic medical news, to justify their decision to sacrifice their unwanted child for money.",t3_z4e3x2

3) if you have a baby outside of marriage why should anybody else have to pay for it? Women can choose between abstinence, 40 types of birth control, plan b, abortion, adoption and safe haven baby drop offs. Your body, your choice, your money. Don't like it? Get married before you have a baby.

Likely, the zeroing in on specific groups is merely a way to focus on the issues that most profoundly affect those groups, even though they are also symptoms of broader problems, e.g. men are treated in grossly uneven fashion when it comes to child custody, for instance.

he was 15 and therefore a minor who cannot consent to sex( as confirmed by judge). this should be considered rape of a minor.

she was deemed mentally unfit to stand trial, so that raises questions about whether she is a fit parent. i think they have been dishonest about the ""extreme anxiety and other issues""

I work with vulnerable adults who have extreme anxiety and other conditions and they are deemed to have  full mental capacity until proven otherwise, they are also criminally liable for their behaviour( i know of one who is currently in prison).

i'm beginning to wonder why CQC aren't involved as this is a breach of the duty of care act which can result in a custodial sentence,regardless of mental capacity..

I also have got to ask the question  of how was it that this person was recruited?

was the college so desperate to recruit people( because of the poor pay, conditions etc) that they overlooked this person character?. Many care companies are in a situation where they don't want to pay what is required to get good staff and therefore they employ people who are not suited for this role.

I find it so depressing that things have gotten much worse instead of swinging back into any range of normality, where even ‘normal' was still very misandrist but at least somewhat manageable/expected for most people. Now, things are so bad that all men are openly attacked nearly 24/7, and to make it worse, this is encouraged. Some of our society legitimately treat men as sub-inhuman pond scum and worse. Men are viewed as disgusting sickening beings that only do bad things and everything on this planet that is bad is solely the fault of all men and not a single woman ever.

I just stumbled upon a post at a rising in popularity women dominated pop-culture sub where users there were encouraging blatant sexism in the form of body shaming men about having “small penises” as in insult for opening filtering or even just talking to a woman at a social outing. They were being serious, no sarcasm. Another poster commented on how that comment and behavior was body shaming and stopping to “their” level and the majority attacked them and basically said it's impossible to discriminate men because they are the majority. Shaming wasn't even commented on. The consensus there is that all men deserve to be shamed due to the vastly and enormously small percentage of men that do horrible atrocities like rape and murder. Once again, there is no difference to them between those sick fucks and all men. I'm beginning to see these comments and similar instances of shaming/bullying out in the open in public. Just imagine what this is doing to young men like teenagers and even younger boys. Constantly being treated lower than women, being told they're never good enough and owe society everything just because they were born a male, etc. This is a cancer and we're already seeing some men lose it and lash out and/or commit suicide. A ton of men are also getting extremely depressed and despondent because they fear even talking to a girl at the bar could lead to them getting fired from work and lose most if not all of their friends over a false accusation or misunderstanding even. Shits gone to far man. I really see why some users here have given up on relationships with women and the others who actually fear them and feel personally attacked.

You would think if indeed it's true that women are still constantly mistreated (in the U.S.A. at least), that they would feel a ton of empathy for a man who went through the same kind of attacks and discrimination but no, instead these people just put them down further, blame them, and further discriminate. Men are treated like non-feeling objects that sometimes exist for the benefit of women when they feel like “playing” with them. I pray things will get better for mankind.

Particularly in the American culture that seems to prefer punishment over rehabilitation, labeling something semi-common as a mental illness risks misdiagnosis with potentially serious consequences. Not that we have asylums anymore, but these are people we would send there if we did.

The fact that they are willing to do anything to have a child and put you thought hell means it's just the start. That being said not all of them are like that.

Look, I sort (potentially) agree that filing for paternity against the original intention was likely an unsavory decision.

But if u/bnhncnyc wants a peripheral, non-existant, or even an uncle type of role in a kid's life, and a lesbian couple wants a baby and either doesn't mind it or wants the relationship for them or the child, why should that in any way be verboten or morally impugned?

In my opinion, as a general rule, two or more adults should be able to do what they want, by agreement, so long as:

1. The choices are freely made, without coercion or deception.&#10;  

2. Not predatory, and *preferably* made while each party is reasonably informed.&#10;

(I know I wouldn't want them to be able to bring it back to me.) 

From what you wrote, the situation didn't qualify as abusive, it's just that the parents were very poor and I'll equipped, which is a situation tons of children are, unfortunately, born into. From the information given, one or more of the parents might have been rather caring and sufficiently providing for the child.

That said, based on the story you told, I wouldn't be surprised if the child does have a better life with you involved than without. I'm trying to say this gently without sugar coating it: in my opinion, based on the story as told here, the child may have a better life with you involved, and she may be very glad you made this choice one day, but I still find the decision analgous to forcing your way into custody of your neighbor's kid solely because they are poor and less responsible than is ideal.",t3_z4i9y8

They filed for the paternity recognition without even informing me as well. It felt to me as if I was barely a human to them, but rather just a means to an end. I didn't like that. It made me come to the conclusion that it's pretty dehumanizing to be a ""sperm donor"" as a whole, and especially under circumstances like this. It's not just that they are poor, irresponsible and live with one of them's parents... it's also that they are, to my view now, not good people, and they clearly don't have the baby's best interest as a priority or they would have at least waited until both had a job and a place to live? Why did they make me sign a paper without any legal binding? What kind of people do that? This had never happened to me before. I could never feel OK abandoning my baby with such people. I mean... they also sent me pictures and videos of the baby, I could see how cute she is and how much she looks like me... I have lost count of how many nights I've spent crying because of it. It's very emotionally abusive. She is 4 months old and I have never been allowed to hold her in my arms. I'll never be able to just brush my baby's face off my mind. They should have waited and done it through a licensed clinic with a completely anonymous sperm donor.

Behind a paywall I have archived around, but Harvard research that women are more likely than men in starting or escalating domestic violence and those women are by far the women most likely to be injured in DV. That doesn't say all women injured are perpetrators themselves, but it does indicate the problem goes beyond the feminist/pop culture model of ""violence against women"".

It includes:

> > Almost 25% of the people surveyed — 28% of women and 19% of men — said there was some violence in their relationship. Women admitted perpetrating more violence (25% versus 11%) as well as being victimized more by violence (19% versus 16%) than men did. According to both men and women, 50% of this violence was reciprocal, that is, involved both parties, and in those cases the woman was more likely to have been the first to strike.

This is a long meta study that shows we've known domestic violence isn't gendered for decades. It is good analysis. It summarizes the results of dozens of studies across decades.  Not ONE study.  LOTS.

Popculture article - 

https://thedailycounter.com/male-victims-of-domestic-violence-are-they-ignored/

Most domestic violence research today is research of ""violence against women"" from grants specifically looking for data on violence against women, not gender neutral research.





The rates of partner homicides didn't used to be that far apart. Then women got help and resources and the rate they killed their husbands dropped a lot. Men didn't get DV shelters they could use to protect their kids from their abuser without getting kidnapping charges giving the abuser an upper hand in custody, government funded help to allow them to get easy restraining orders, DV intervention public policy and programs that favored them, etc. Therefore the rate that husbands kill their wives hasn't dropped much. Maybe if we want to eliminate the desperate husbands in mutually abusive relationships killing their wives, we should give them better options. That would probably save a lot of women's lives just like doing it for women has saved a lot of mens lives.

""Gender Differences in Patterns and Trends in U.S. Homicide, 1976–2015"" by James Alan Fox and Emma E. Fridel. The data comes from FBI statistics (""FBI's Supplementary Homicide Reports, SHR"").

https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/vio.2017.0016?journalCode=vio&

Here's part of the conclusion that the authors came to:

> > Among all the results already reported, perhaps the most striking and important surrounds the trends in intimate partner homicide, particularly in the context of ongoing efforts to curtail domestic violence. Some researchers argue that the reduction in male intimate partner victimization, a decline of nearly 60% over the past four decades, is because of an increase in the availability of social and legal interventions, liberalized divorce laws, greater economic independence of women, as well as a reduction in the stigma of being the victim of domestic violence. Although at an earlier time a woman may have felt compelled to kill her abusive spouse as her only defense, she now has more opportunities to escape the relationship through means such as protective orders and shelters (Dugan et al. 1999; Fox et al. 2012). As a tragic irony, the wider availability of support services for abused women did not appear to have quite the intended effect, at least through the 1980s, as only male victimization declined.

Here is a graph of intimate partner homicides by sex over the years from the study. Notice the trend for women as they got help vs men that didn't?

God forbid we help men, even if it would save womens lives.

I also suggest you look into the Duluth Model of Domestic Violence Intervention which results in men being beaten by their wives being arrested more often than the perpetrator when they call the police for help.

Ellen Pence (The creator) herself has written,

> > ""By determining that the need or desire for power was the motivating force behind battering, we created a conceptual framework that, in fact, did not fit the lived experience of many of the men and women we were working with. The DAIP staff [...] remained undaunted by the difference in our theory and the actual experiences of those we were working with [...] It was the cases themselves that created the chink in each of our theoretical suits of armor. Speaking for myself, I found that many of the men I interviewed did not seem to articulate a desire for power over their partner. Although I relentlessly took every opportunity to point out to men in the groups that they were so motivated and merely in denial, the fact that few men ever articulated such a desire went unnoticed by me and many of my coworkers. Eventually, we realized that we were finding what we had already predetermined to find.""

I suggest you read the Overview section of Erin Pizzey's wikipedia page or one of her books. She was the founder of Refuge. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_Pizzey

She created the worlds first domestic violence shelters. After opening several for women in the UK, she suggested that men were being abused too (often by women staying in her shelters) and men needed a shelter too. She was then slandered, her kids were threatened, her dog was killed, bricks were thrown through her windows, and she was removed from the DV organization she founded (now known as Refuge which has just recently lost funding for harming male victims for decades). She fled the country for her childrens safety and became an outspoken DV activist and anti-feminist once they moved out on their own.

That's what happens when a DV advocate tries to help men.

In the US, VAWA replaced the gender neutral Family Violence Prevention and Services Act giving extra rights/services to women and taking services/rights away from men and children. The funding and laws became very gendered. Many of the laws in the act were challenged in court and had to be rewritten. The funding is still very gendered 25 years later, so... We have lots of grants to study ""violence against women"" rather than gender neutral domestic violence, lots of grants to develop separate programs to ""teach men not to rape"" and ""teach women to report rape"", lots of perpetrator intervention programs for men but none for women, lots of DV resources for women but almost none for men.",t3_z4kjbh

ixthi6a,t1_ixt6ym9,"Not by the lay persons definition of rape - nonconsensual sex.

The statistical definition of rape is controlled by feminists. Feminists actively block acknowledgment of males being heterosexual rape victims, support services for them, and laws to protect raped men and boys.

For statistical reporting, rape has been carefully defined as forced *penetration of the victim* in most of the world. Please listen to this feminist professor Mary P Koss explain that a woman raping a man isn't rape. Hear her explain in her own voice just a few years ago - https://clyp.it/uckbtczn.  I encourage you to listen to what she is saying.  (Really.  Listen to it! Think about it from a man's perspective.)

She is considered the foremost expert on sexual violence in the US.  **She is the one that started the 1 in 4 American college women is sexually assaulted myth by counting all sorts of things the ""victims"" didn't.**  A man misinterpreting a situation going in for a kiss and then backing off when she pulls back, puts up her hand, or turns her cheek is counted as a sexual assault on a woman even if she doesn't think it was.  **As you hear in her own words the woman's studies professor and trusted expert that literally wrote the book on measuring prevalence of sexual violence does not call a woman drugging and riding a man bareback rape ... or even label it sexual assault ... it is merely ""unwanted contact""** 

You see she has been saying this for decades **and** was instrumental in creating the methodologies most (including the US and many other government agencies around the world) use for gathering rape statistics.  E.g. 

Detecting the Scope of Rape : A Review of Prevalence Research Methods. Author: Mary P. Koss. Journal of Interpersonal Violence Volume: 8 Issue: 2 Dated: (**June 1993**) Page: 206

> > > Although consideration of male victims is within the scope of the legal statutes, **it is important to restrict the term rape to instances where male victims were penetrated by offenders. It is inappropriate to consider as a rape victim a man who engages in unwanted sexual intercourse with a woman.**

Src: http://boysmeneducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Koss-1993-Detecting-the-Scope-of-Rape-a-review-of-prevalence-research-methods-see-p.-206-last-paragraph.pdf

She is an advisor to the CDC, FBI, Congress, and researchers around the world and promoting the idea that men cannot be raped by women.  There **was** a proposal to explicitly include forced envelopment in the latest FBI update to the definition of rape but after a closed door meeting with her and N.O.W. lobbiests, it mysteriously disappeared.  She has many many followers and fellow researchers that follow her methodology and quote her studies.  That is where most people get the idea rape is just a man on woman crime.  Men are fairly rarely penetrated and it is almost always by another man.

Most people talking about sexual violence refer to the ""rape"" (penetrated) numbers as influenced by Mary Koss's methodologies, but in the US the CDC also gathered the data for ""made to penetrate"" (enveloped) in the 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2015 NISVS studies.

As an example lets look at the 2011 survey numbers:
https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6308a1.htm

> **an estimated 1.6% of women (or approximately 1.9 million women) were raped in the 12 months before taking the survey**

and

> The case count for men reporting rape in the preceding 12 months was too small to produce a statistically reliable prevalence estimate.

vs

> **an estimated 1.7% of men were made to penetrate a perpetrator in the 12 months preceding the survey**

and 

> Characteristics of Sexual Violence Perpetrators
**For female rape victims, an estimated 99.0% had only male perpetrators**. In addition, an estimated 94.7% of female victims of sexual violence other than rape had only male perpetrators. For male victims, the sex of the perpetrator varied by the type of sexual violence experienced. **The majority of male rape victims (an estimated 79.3%) had only male perpetrators**. For three of the **other forms of sexual violence, a majority of male victims had only female perpetrators: being made to penetrate (an estimated 82.6%)**, sexual coercion (an estimated 80.0%),

[NISVS 2010](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs_report2010-a.pdf) showed in the past 12 months, 1.1% of men were made to penetrate and 1.1% of women were raped. Table 2.1 & 2.2 on pages 18/19.

[NISVS 2011](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/ss/ss6308.pdf) showed  in the past 12 months, 1.7% of men were made to penetrate & 1.6% of women were raped. Table 1 on page 5.

[NISVS 2012](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf) showed in the past 12 months, 1.7% of men were made to penetrate & 1.0% of women were raped. Table A.1 & A.5 on pages 217/222.

[NISVS 2015](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/2015data-brief508.pdf) showed in the past 12 months, 0.7% of men were made to penetrate & 1.2% of women were raped. Table 1 & 2 on pages 15/16.

Varies a bit from year to year, but pretty even overall. In both cases the four year annual percentages add up to five. The numbers for perpetrators vary a little from year to year too. Something like 79-84% of made to penetrate (nonconsensual envelopment) victims are victimized by women. Something like 96-99% of rape (nonconsensual penetration) victims are victimized by men. So in the 2010s, it averages out that a typical year has ~60% men & ~40% women as perpetrators of nonconsensual sex outside prisons rather than the 99:1 ratio discussed.

But since made to penetrate is not rape, the narrative is that men are rapists and women are victims and boys/men that are victims are victims of men. Therefore most of the gender studies folks create programs to teach men not to rape (e.g. /r/science/comments/3rmapx/science_ama_series_im_laura_salazar_associate/).  Therefore there is justification for having gendered rape support services which means almost none for males victimized by females.  **These misleading stats are ammo to tell men to shut up about rape because 1 in 5 women are raped vs ""only"" 1 in 71 men** and dismiss raped men because men are one group ""nearly all the men were raped by other men"" so somehow raped men are to blame because they are men...

If you don't like CDC data: 

Scientific American: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sexual-victimization-by-women-is-more-common-than-previously-known

*A recent study of youth found, strikingly, that females comprise 48 percent of those who self-reported committing rape or attempted rape at age 18-19.*

The Atlantic:
https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/11/the-understudied-female-sexual-predator/503492/

*a 2014 study of 284 men and boys in college and high school found that 43 percent reported being sexually coerced, with the majority of coercive incidents resulting in unwanted sexual intercourse. Of them, 95 percent reported only female perpetrators.*

and 

*National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions found in a sample of 43,000 adults little difference in the sex of self-reported sexual perpetrators. Of those who affirmed that they had ‘ever forced someone to have sex with you against their will,' 43.6 percent were female and 56.4 percent were male.”*

Time:
http://time.com/3393442/cdc-rape-numbers

*when asked about experiences in the last 12 months, men reported being “made to penetrate”—either by physical force or due to intoxication—at virtually the same rates as women reported rape (both 1.1 percent in 2010, and 1.7 and 1.6 respectively in 2011).*

Just maybe, rape isn't a gendered issue and we should stop treating it like one.  But if we acknowledge that, then we would have to point the blame at ""rapists"", rather than ""men"".

Isn't just the US.  

Feminists lobbied against gender neutral rape laws in India, so women are not rapists and men victimized by women are not rape victims. https://www.timesofindia.com/india/Activists-join-chorus-against-gender-neutral-rape-laws/articleshow/18840879.cms

So a woman physically forcing sex on a man is not a rape in India, but a man breaking an engagement after having sex with his fiancee is a rape.

Israeli feminists were concerned if a woman raping a man was recognized by law, a man could threaten to make false accusations against the woman after the man raped her in order to keep her from reporting. Apparently false accusations are a problem for women, so they fixed this by blocking the legislation that would have made rape a gender neutral crime.

https://m.jpost.com/Israel/Womens-groups-Cancel-law-charging-women-with-rape

Nepal feminists also blocked legislation there ...

> Women's rights activists had criticised the draft ordinance saying it wasn't empathetic towards the plight of the victims. They said that having a provision saying even men could be victims of rape could could further weaken the women rape victims' fight for justice.

**Even if you only care about women, you should still stop women from raping because the majority of men convicted of raping women were sexually violated by adult women when they were boys.**  Multiple studies in the US, UK, and Canada have shown this.  Around 10 of them cited here.

ixt9ckn,t1_ixt8qjh,"Extreme side of domestic violence doesn't make up domestic violence plus I don't know any research on the “extreme side of domestic violence” also again don't  really about any of that has nothing to do with domestic abuse or even the entire argument your kind of just moving  goalposts from what the initial point, domestic abuse is not all gendered in a way to justify a campaign for heterosexual relationships that puts it in a gendered light",t3_z4kjbh

However, I find it weird in general to ‘take down' a women's domestic abuse advertisement to help bring enlightenment to men's domestic abuse. And then you bring up that women abuse men at a much higher rate with an article with many fallacies. If I assume it's 100% true, I counter it with severity of domestic violence between genders bc rape vs slaps are two very different things and the disparity between genders is evident.",t3_z4kjbh

Idk how much these advertisements effect anything tbh… I will say it would be very helpful to have a lot of advertising focused on domestic abuse that occurs in men. Which I've also said. I read ur links you could look at mine. I understand why you find it odd to have a women's domestic abuse awareness ad when it isn't only a women's issue, but if women are more severely effected, not effected overall, then it's different. Statistically it's different between men and women, but any man can 100% call most domestic abuse organization and most likely get taken care of in the same manner as a woman.",t3_z4kjbh
ixta5mf,t1_ixt953k,"Well first of all your putting words in my mouth I don't want it to be taken down because and replaced with a man campaign I want it to be gender neutral in the first place because domestic abuse is gender neutral and incorporates both gender especially since women significantly get more funding, help and support in terms of domestic abuse than men do, also in non reciprocal relationships but most relationships are reciprocal also it doesn't really have fallacies one of your opinion while noted can easily be argued this wouldn't really provide a significant enough and change and the other was kind more of the line of a anecdotal opinion, anyway I can't find any statistic that talks about rape in domestic violence situations on its own normally it's thrown in with physical violence and stalking as well, but still even with that it's not even a large split enough to justify gendering and tbh regardless it still doesn't justify it we don't use of that same logic when it comes to men.",t3_z4kjbh

Domestic abuse  is domestic abuse  it's not a competition  there's no more severely affected than someone else, I mean definitely not there's not only plenty of information while anecdotal of men not getting help some even being blamed for it since many of these programs follow Duluth model, but there's actual research as well https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334555147_Male_victims_of_female-perpetrated_intimate_partner_violence_help-seeking_and_reporting_behaviors_A_qualitative_study",t3_z4kjbh

I'm just saying I understand why it's focused on women's domestic abuse along with why domestic abuse is more focused on women.

\-As of this writing, at least a couple of female students have been apparently been unfairly expelled from university after being hauled before Title IX star chambers. Even among the male students who suffered such a fate, all of these guys had immediate families who suffered right alongside them. Families made up of men AND women alike. Our entire nation suffers when folks of either gender are denied a shot at secondary education and by extension, upward mobility. Given this, is it wise to continue framing this problem as a ""men's issue"", rather than an American one that affects us all adversely?

\-The much celebrated documentary Divorce Corps depicted 2-3 women who also apparently lost their kids unfairly after a divorce, and it's a fair bet that at least a few more chicks like this out there. Yeah, this problem may affect men disproportionately, nonetheless we're giving up an immense tactical advantage, by not hammering home to the public that the absence of shared parenting legislation harms men, women, and kids in the most grievous ways imaginable 

I could go on at length as to the many ways in which so-called ""men's issues"" are symptomatic of ills which plague our civilization more broadly, ones which harm men and women both, but I'm fairly certain you catch my drift.

If I were you I would NOT sign an acknowledgement of paternity. I would ask for a DNA test.

You are basically handing your fate to someone else. If you insist she keep it and it turns out to be yours. You are responsible, morally and financially. Put your money where your dick went. You're done. 

It sounds far better to help this, what's sounds to me to be an incredibly unsuitable mother, not have this child at all. 

If you insist she has it, you better be fully prepared to face the consequences and be the best dad you can, no matter what SHE decides. Because that's how it goes.

Ask for proof of the pregnancy - like, she comes to your place, pees in a cup, and you perform the test after making sure the urine is warm - and, if it's real, then pay for the abortion.  Make the appointment and drive her there yourself.  You can't force her to do it, but you can make sure that it doesn't... just never happen.

Other than that, on a practical level I'd say there are low chances that you made her pregnant, so why is she asking you to pay for abortion anyway? Seems to me like a way to get the abortion without having her ""friends"" pay for it.

Also, I sometimes do believe in psychic phenomenons, but would an unborn baby ask ""please kill me""??

4. If she decides to have the kid and puts you down on the certificate, demand a paternity test. If I didn't miscount, she slept with 5 different dudes - which isn't morally wrong or bad, but also means there's a 4 in 5 chance that you're possibly not the father. 
5. Next time use birth control until you're sure the person you're being intimate with is trustworthy and not likely to try and babytrap you. Do NOT let her take the condom out, put it on, suck on it after it's on or take it off. 
6. When the whole thing is behind you: introspect. A lot. Figure out what drew you in. Analyse the situation you encountered and the other person in it. Get clear with yourself about which red flags you didn't spot while it happened. Important: don't beat yourself up - people a lot wiser than any of us fell for rapid emotionally manipulation techniques, especially coming from the Cluster B crowd. The goal of analysing and introspecting is to leave you with a clearer understanding and, hopefully, better footing in future encounters with actual fucking crazy people.

The doula system is unregulated You DON'T need to be certified but if you do bother then it's literally a 3-4 month (studying 10 hours a week) course costing about $800 USD. You could probably get the certification in less than a month if you tried 

They way i see it hes either being extorted for the cash as in the baby is probably not even his and hes just the schmuck they are gonna try and pin it in on (why not free income for the next 18 years and a nice check now if shes not faking it all to begin with)  or they are literally that broke I can't see that sort of business being very profitable and it probably won't be easy to get clients either if the sex videos have come to light

I love my daughter to death but I didn't get to teach, raise or see my daughter, my daughter thinks I'm a piece of shit, who never was around or involved. she's right to say that but  I had to pay basically my rapist a paycheck every month, she transferred her debt to me (she had quite a bit) and all this under threat of jail. It was literally a one night stand, I protested said I wasn't ready to have a child and had no money that our child would be in poverty she said she didn't care went for child support on day 1. I literally don't know what a child costs under a normal loving relationship I only know what a child costs through child support. I have nearly worked 10,000 days straight, nearly. let me say that again I LITERALLY nearly have worked 10'000 days straight, forced to, because there's a gun to my head saying I will go to jail if I don't, I barely was able to keep my head above water paying being forced to pay this sycophant. it literally took 16 hours a day for the first 10 years 13 hrs a day for the rest. and if not that, pretty fucking close. your not able to be a father let alone even see your kid. DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT play by their rules. fucking leave, go underground. and never again stick your dick in crazy or ANYONE your not willing to have and raise a child with.

its like this shitty employee, I never hired, that I can't fire, and when I never had a business. all because I didn't want my kid, my blood, on the streets. punished for having a heart.

it would have been better to disappear, and then when my kid grew up, wondering where dad was and after her finding me, I could have said your mom tried to baby trap/rape me cause she's a shallow irresponsible piece of shit. here daughter, fuck her, I have a 100,000 grand that I can spend on you, now. (because you bailed and won't pay her)

instead, what do I have now? the best years, a 3rd of my life, gone. wasted away. 100,000 grand? wasted, gone. I have to start over, from basically 0 because I was never able to save, I have a daughter who hates me, doesn't understand, is a slut, raised without morals or ethics, raised without religion, a daughter who I haven't talked too, in 4-5 years. don't be me. don't give cunts like this ANYTHING. your parents? fuck their opinion, they are either on your side or hers. mine? on the fucking cunts side.

I think generally viewing people on the individual standpoint is far better than viewing each other based on group identity, but that's the opposite of mainstream feminism nowdays. I guess it comes down to the tribalism. Our tribe vs there's. It's doing a lot of harm. There are good parts of it for sure, but I think sometimes it gives women more to worry and be mad about than anything. Maybe it's because we as humans weren't built for the unlimited amounts of data we have access to nowdays. Used to the focus was on your family and your community. Now it's national and global knowledge. Which can be good, but maybe you here about 4 or 5 bad things in the nation perpetrated by a certain group. The human brain doesn't look for context it looks for patterns so many of us assume correlation and causation. That it's because of the group that did it.

ixuybff,t1_ixuxvrg,"Happy to share how rape statistics excluded nonconsensual envelopment and made to penetrate numbers.

The statistical definition of rape is controlled by feminists. Feminists actively block acknowledgment of males being heterosexual rape victims, support services for them, and laws to protect raped men and boys.

For statistical reporting, rape has been carefully defined as forced *penetration of the victim* in most of the world. Please listen to this feminist professor Mary P Koss explain that a woman raping a man isn't rape. Hear her explain in her own voice just a few years ago - https://clyp.it/uckbtczn.  I encourage you to listen to what she is saying.  (Really.  Listen to it! Think about it from a man's perspective.)

She is considered the foremost expert on sexual violence in the US.  **She is the one that started the 1 in 4 American college women is sexually assaulted myth by counting all sorts of things the ""victims"" didn't.**  A man misinterpreting a situation going in for a kiss and then backing off when she pulls back, puts up her hand, or turns her cheek is counted as a sexual assault on a woman even if she doesn't think it was.  **As you hear in her own words the woman's studies professor and trusted expert that literally wrote the book on measuring prevalence of sexual violence does not call a woman drugging and riding a man bareback rape ... or even label it sexual assault ... it is merely ""unwanted contact""** 

You see she has been saying this for decades **and** was instrumental in creating the methodologies most (including the US and many other government agencies around the world) use for gathering rape statistics.  E.g. 

Detecting the Scope of Rape : A Review of Prevalence Research Methods. Author: Mary P. Koss. Journal of Interpersonal Violence Volume: 8 Issue: 2 Dated: (**June 1993**) Page: 206

> > > Although consideration of male victims is within the scope of the legal statutes, **it is important to restrict the term rape to instances where male victims were penetrated by offenders. It is inappropriate to consider as a rape victim a man who engages in unwanted sexual intercourse with a woman.**

Src: http://boysmeneducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Koss-1993-Detecting-the-Scope-of-Rape-a-review-of-prevalence-research-methods-see-p.-206-last-paragraph.pdf

She is an advisor to the CDC, FBI, Congress, and researchers around the world and promoting the idea that men cannot be raped by women.  There **was** a proposal to explicitly include forced envelopment in the latest FBI update to the definition of rape but after a closed door meeting with her and N.O.W. lobbiests, it mysteriously disappeared.  She has many many followers and fellow researchers that follow her methodology and quote her studies.  That is where most people get the idea rape is just a man on woman crime.  Men are fairly rarely penetrated and it is almost always by another man.

Most people talking about sexual violence refer to the ""rape"" (penetrated) numbers as influenced by Mary Koss's methodologies, but in the US the CDC also gathered the data for ""made to penetrate"" (enveloped) in the 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2015 NISVS studies.

As an example lets look at the 2011 survey numbers:
https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6308a1.htm

> **an estimated 1.6% of women (or approximately 1.9 million women) were raped in the 12 months before taking the survey**

and

> The case count for men reporting rape in the preceding 12 months was too small to produce a statistically reliable prevalence estimate.

vs

> **an estimated 1.7% of men were made to penetrate a perpetrator in the 12 months preceding the survey**

and 

> Characteristics of Sexual Violence Perpetrators
**For female rape victims, an estimated 99.0% had only male perpetrators**. In addition, an estimated 94.7% of female victims of sexual violence other than rape had only male perpetrators. For male victims, the sex of the perpetrator varied by the type of sexual violence experienced. **The majority of male rape victims (an estimated 79.3%) had only male perpetrators**. For three of the **other forms of sexual violence, a majority of male victims had only female perpetrators: being made to penetrate (an estimated 82.6%)**, sexual coercion (an estimated 80.0%),

[NISVS 2010](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs_report2010-a.pdf) showed in the past 12 months, 1.1% of men were made to penetrate and 1.1% of women were raped. Table 2.1 & 2.2 on pages 18/19.

[NISVS 2011](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/ss/ss6308.pdf) showed  in the past 12 months, 1.7% of men were made to penetrate & 1.6% of women were raped. Table 1 on page 5.

[NISVS 2012](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf) showed in the past 12 months, 1.7% of men were made to penetrate & 1.0% of women were raped. Table A.1 & A.5 on pages 217/222.

[NISVS 2015](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/2015data-brief508.pdf) showed in the past 12 months, 0.7% of men were made to penetrate & 1.2% of women were raped. Table 1 & 2 on pages 15/16.

Varies a bit from year to year, but pretty even overall. In both cases the four year annual percentages add up to five. The numbers for perpetrators vary a little from year to year too. Something like 79-84% of made to penetrate (nonconsensual envelopment) victims are victimized by women. Something like 96-99% of rape (nonconsensual penetration) victims are victimized by men. So in the 2010s, it averages out that a typical year has ~60% men & ~40% women as perpetrators of nonconsensual sex outside prisons rather than the 99:1 ratio discussed.

But since made to penetrate is not rape, the narrative is that men are rapists and women are victims and boys/men that are victims are victims of men. Therefore most of the gender studies folks create programs to teach men not to rape (e.g. /r/science/comments/3rmapx/science_ama_series_im_laura_salazar_associate/).  Therefore there is justification for having gendered rape support services which means almost none for males victimized by females.  **These misleading stats are ammo to tell men to shut up about rape because 1 in 5 women are raped vs ""only"" 1 in 71 men** and dismiss raped men because men are one group ""nearly all the men were raped by other men"" so somehow raped men are to blame because they are men...

If you don't like CDC data: 

Scientific American: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sexual-victimization-by-women-is-more-common-than-previously-known

*A recent study of youth found, strikingly, that females comprise 48 percent of those who self-reported committing rape or attempted rape at age 18-19.*

The Atlantic:
https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/11/the-understudied-female-sexual-predator/503492/

*a 2014 study of 284 men and boys in college and high school found that 43 percent reported being sexually coerced, with the majority of coercive incidents resulting in unwanted sexual intercourse. Of them, 95 percent reported only female perpetrators.*

and 

*National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions found in a sample of 43,000 adults little difference in the sex of self-reported sexual perpetrators. Of those who affirmed that they had ‘ever forced someone to have sex with you against their will,' 43.6 percent were female and 56.4 percent were male.”*

Time:
http://time.com/3393442/cdc-rape-numbers

*when asked about experiences in the last 12 months, men reported being “made to penetrate”—either by physical force or due to intoxication—at virtually the same rates as women reported rape (both 1.1 percent in 2010, and 1.7 and 1.6 respectively in 2011).*

Just maybe, rape isn't a gendered issue and we should stop treating it like one.  But if we acknowledge that, then we would have to point the blame at ""rapists"", rather than ""men"".

Isn't just the US.  

Feminists lobbied against gender neutral rape laws in India, so women are not rapists and men victimized by women are not rape victims. https://www.timesofindia.com/india/Activists-join-chorus-against-gender-neutral-rape-laws/articleshow/18840879.cms

So a woman physically forcing sex on a man is not a rape in India, but a man breaking an engagement after having sex with his fiancee is a rape.

Israeli feminists were concerned if a woman raping a man was recognized by law, a man could threaten to make false accusations against the woman after the man raped her in order to keep her from reporting. Apparently false accusations are a problem for women, so they fixed this by blocking the legislation that would have made rape a gender neutral crime.

https://m.jpost.com/Israel/Womens-groups-Cancel-law-charging-women-with-rape

Nepal feminists also blocked legislation there ...

> Women's rights activists had criticised the draft ordinance saying it wasn't empathetic towards the plight of the victims. They said that having a provision saying even men could be victims of rape could could further weaken the women rape victims' fight for justice.

**Even if you only care about women, you should still stop women from raping because the majority of men convicted of raping women were sexually violated by adult women when they were boys.**  Multiple studies in the US, UK, and Canada have shown this.  Around 10 of them cited here.

http://empathygap.uk/?p=1993#_Toc498111528

In other words they often default to the ""they're not real feminists"" when you see a post from feminist reddit that is blatant misandry. I know because in the anti-feminist's reddit, this is often a common thing especially because many of them come in and make those statements.

The truth is that the majority of women are attracted to men and want to make themselves attractive to men. Feminism is trying to make these women deny this truth and it's making them miserable. I think a lot of women have woken up to this realization and they're starting to turn against the movement in the process. Any Feminists who disagree are just living in denial.

But from experience I can say, that even if I thought it's justice, I still was living in fear, to be abused or assaulted or insulted. I had bitter days and paranoia. Feminism poison didn't heal my childhood sexual abuse trauma (caused by stepfather). Fucking feminism hurt me, I had to take time to adjust my mindset to heal the cancer myself. And someone has to pay for that.

Feminists demanding so absurd privileges, believing in lies, being spoiled and simped for, makes them super spoiled and take things for granted immensely.

A woman who decides to go for the trad lifestyle will find a man to enable her sooner or later and both tradcucks and femtards will applaud her for being so stunning and brave to decide to make the ""sacrifice"" for her man when it's really the other way around.

But it seriously seems that something outside of culture is at play here and honestly in a way i think we are all victims to it and its sad. I think alot if not the majority of women are easily strung along (as well as children of course) whether this be fear based im not sure, but i think they're continuing to be made the main targets of this manipulation tactic to socially and politically divide people.

Some evolutionary psychologists apply the same thinking to psychology, arguing that the modularity of mind is similar to that of the body and with different modular adaptations serving different functions.

> What exactly do you have to lose if women get equal rights?
  
What rights do women lack that men have? For comparison, a few rights that women have and men lack are: 
  
* Presumed custody of children in the case of divorce. This was exacerbated by the Tender Years Doctrine, spearheaded by first-wave feminist Caroline Norton, and perpetuated by modern feminists through lobbying groups' efforts against rebuttable presumed shared custody. 
  
* Seperation of consent to sex from consent to parenthood and the responsibilities thereof. Feminist commentators have said that a unilaterally male-controlled contraceptive would ""take away womens' choices"". 
  
* Bodily integrity (i.e., genital mutilation. For girls its a violation of international law; for men it's at best unusual but tolerable, and at worst actively campaigned for as an eroneous means of combating AIDS). Feminists, while claiming to be advocates for ""equality"", are curiously quiet on this issue, compared to their efforts on FGM.  
  
*  Immunity from accusations of rape. Rape requires the perpetrator to have a penis, so when women engage in nonconsentual sex with men, he is more likely to be charged than she is. This is mainly the work of Feminist researcher Mary Koss, from whom feminists get the eroneous 1-in-4 statistic. And if a woman gets pregnant from raping a man (or boy), she can sue her rape victim for child support.
  
Obviously some of these would be best reformed by giving men rights (bodily integrity, for instance), while some would be better served by removing womens' privileges (immunity from accusations of rape). Equal treatment, that's all that's required.",t3_z4u3ui

Why?",t3_z4u3ui
ixum5jl,t1_ixts745,"This is deep and you touched it where…I think a lot of us have tried to ignore, this more broad impact of feminism.

I believe there is a desire -idk why or by who- to whittle away at our desire as men and women to be together. Once you're together a family is almost inevitable, sometimes when it's not even the plan. Less couples, less families. In your early years (pre 40) there's so much to do in our modern world I think it's easy to see a partner as inhibiting. So this divide we are experiencing, be it from hookup culture or mgtow, or hot girl summer—is helpful-complicit in ensuring there are less and less reasons for a committed relationship, that could lead to marriage, to seem viable. 

I want to try and address all the things you said. 

-who's running this

Who knows. I think it can benefit so many it's hard to say 

-monetary benefits 

Absolutely! Women, and children on welfare means more tax dollars, more $ in Washington. One day it dawned on me that a family has one home, one washer and dryer, one or two cars. A divided family doubles this. Single people own these things individually. So yes, $$$. 
Families usually eat out less. Buy less drugs and alcohol. Find solace in one another and maybe not therapist, anti depressants and what not. Maybe they strive to improve their lives and the lives of their children. 
Where as single people, hookup people look out for number one. They're consumer number one. That's definitely profitable. 

-where is the bottom? 
I'm not sure. I don't see a lot of space for turning back once we reach it only because it's been such a long journey there and the percentage of people who see this as a bad thing is sooooo slim. It's mostly men, it's mostly white men, it's no longer mostly older (honestly it's shockingly young) 

I agree that strong men are the backbone of a quality and thriving society. One where hard work and fortitude is valued not victimhood. 


I've noticed especially in the past year or more….I guess after the “insurrection at the capital” more women stating online that they would never date a Republican, conservative, Christian, man who supported trump, man who reads redpill content, man who likes Andrew Tate/Jordan Peterson/joe Rogan……
It amuses me because I also see here and on other websites WAYYYY more women seeming interested in domestic house roles, sugar daddies, marriages of convenience. I think the economy did a number on a lot of women, and some of the ones who didn't run to only fans, have run into the wall or patriarchy. This could be a good thing, maybe it just takes a few women in the kitchen to turn the tide lol. 

 I think the bottom looks very dystopian, very controlled and not in a way that fosters quality but in a way that props up one part of the people while utterly neglecting another huge portion. I think the difference between the sad future, and the sad things that look like this now—-is that we will seem content, we will feel content. The conversation we're having here, will not exist there. We will be so throughly white washed of our biological desires and natural male/female tendencies, it won't matter that we're alone, or fat, or just obeying some unseen power. We will be void of any fighting spirit, and just happy to get our social points and go home to the regularly schedule program. 

To OPs point:

Also the fact that Feminists in recent years have taken to social media to glorify abortion hasn't helped you case at all.

Now to get back to my point, I have seen in recent years through YouTube and Tik Tok videos. There are women who are regretting having high body counts because it's turned off a lot of men. There are also women who are taking to social media and to writing articles talking about choosing a career over a family and not being able to find a man by their 40's since most men they probably could have married earlier in their life, have found someone else.

You're misunderstanding coverture laws. A man was legally responsible for the wellbeing of his wife, up to and including being responsible for tax to be paid for his *wife's income* (which you earlier denied could exist on account of women not being ""allowed"" to work). As such, to facilitate his responsibility to his wife, he was permitted the right to dictate how the family income was used. That was until the Married Womens Property Act, which gave women sole rights over their income while keeping men's responsibility - a state used by Suffragette and physician Dr. Elizabeth Wilkes to put her husband in prison for tax-evasion by refusing to disclose her income to him, thus preventing him from paying tax. 
  
> Women weren't allowed to inherit in the US and UK until the mid 1800s

Of course, this is neatly counterpointed by the existence of university educated women (including some first-wave feminists) from a time before women were ""allowed"" an education.

ixw3x25,t3_z51x04,"Then don't?

Men aren't ""forced to be their providers"".

If you're considering marriage, then you should be having a conversation about the future and setting the expectations early. To be comfortable with supporting a SAHM you have to very closely look at the mindset of your future spouse, create very clear expectations of what she's expected to be doing (keeping the house clean, raising the children, preparing the meals) and if you suddenly run into resistance or arguments about how you should be ""doing your share"", you should immediately take the conversation to paper and plan out what each of you are going to be doing for 8-10 hours every weekday.

The most moronic argument that I hear throughout Reddit is ""Being a SAHM is a tough job"" or ""A SAHM works 24 hours a day"". These are arguments of petulant children who have never actually looked after a house. They don't realize that you only really need to invest 15-20 hours a week cleaning to keep the house **utterly spotless**, and that in some instances that time can be stretched if both spouses are willing to do the bare minimum (clean up if you spill something, put your dishes in the dishwasher, put your laundry in the hamper).

So make a plan and use it to address ridiculous claims like ""I have to spend 2 hours every day vacuuming the house"" or ""I have to spend an hour a day doing the laundry"", or ""Cleaning up the kitchen takes 2 full hours every day"". Demonstrate that it can be done efficiently in less time if you have to. Or even offer to do it yourself and take it off their schedule if they're stubbornly sticking to a ridiculous number (then demand they offset that time with another more reasonable activity like doing all of the grocery shopping).

If all else fails, hire a professional maid and watch them make your house -sparkle- in less than 8 hours a week, then let your spouse decide whether they want to go back to work and keep employing the maid... or they'd like to take over that job themselves.

So much of this bullshit surrounding the work of SAHMs is a combination of children that were never expected to clean up after themselves around the house, and have been force fed the same idiotic 1950's tropes about the overworked housewife for their entire lives.

‘Forbidding her to work and keeping her at home is intended to defend her against herself and ensure her happiness. We have
seen the poetic veils used to hide the monotonous burdens she bears: housework and maternity; in exchange for her freedom she was given fallacious treasures of ""femininity"" as a gift. Balzac described this maneuver very well in advising a man to treat her as a slave while persuading her she is a queen. Less cynical, many men endeavor to convince themselves she is truly privileged. There are American sociologists seriously teaching today the theory of ""low-class gain,"" that is, the ""advantages of the lower castes."" In France as well it has often been proclaimed, albeit less scientifically, that workers are indeed lucky not to be obliged to ""present well"", and even more so tramps who could dress in rags and sleep on the streets, pleasures that were forbidden to the comte de Beaumont and those poor Wendel gentlemen. Like the filthy carefree souls cheerfully scratching their vermin, like the joyful black individuals laughing while being lashed, and like these gay Arabs of Souse with a smile on their lips, burying their children who starved to death, the woman enjoys this incomparable privilege: irresponsibility. Without difficulties, without responsibility, without cares, she obviously
has ""the best part"". What is troubling is that by a stubborn perversity, undoubtedly linked to original sin, across centuries and countries, the

Kind of.  I'd say most women have little trouble finding men who interested in them, especially when they're young (like 20-25).  So in that respect, you're right, they pretty much all get a chance.

The first big problem I think many women face is that it can be hard for them to tell the difference between the men who are mostly only interested in the bedroom and will never commit long term to them and the ones who are genuinely marriage minded.  

The second main problem I think women have in dating is that they find the vast majority of men sexually unattractive and the men they do find attractive are the same men that most other women find attractive, so the competition for them is stiff and there simply aren't enough to go around.  So, for the ones that fail to snag one and start hearing their biological clock banging louder and louder, they get stuck with the choice between marrying a guy that likes them but she's not attracted to or just realizing she's going to be single the rest of her life.  Trying to baby-trap a guy she's attracted to seems to be a popular 3rd option.",t3_z51x04

I think it comes down to many women marrying men that they're not sexually attracted to or barely attracted to.  As men, we don't really understand this because our bar for a woman to be marriage material tends to be higher than our bar for sleeping with one.  But surveys of women find that women view 80% of men as below average in attractiveness.  Now, if that was fairly random in the men they find attractive, it wouldn't be the end of the world, but it's not, it's very concentrated toward the top of the attractiveness scale.  So joe average guy has a pretty high likelihood of getting fooled by a woman who actually isn't very attracted to him and then finds himself in a deadbedroom after she's done having kids.

> So many friends wives went back to work as fast as possible only to have their entire paycheck go to child care.

These guys may not be a dumb as you think though.  There is the advantage that she'll keep moving up the career ladder.  The bigger advantage of this for the husband (or whichever is the working spouse) - he's much more likely to get a more fair arrangement if it should come to divorce.  

Stay-at-home parents tend to get more custody of kids since were doing more of the parenting while the working spouse gets stuck continuing to do their part of financial support well after the divorce between child support and possibly alimony too.

Most of the women I ran into when dating either seemed too attached to her career, or made me suspicious that she'd end up being the lazy variety of a SAHM.  

The main issues I ran into with this arrangement with the woman I married is that the house was usually a mess and she had a tendency to overspend a little.  Other than that, it worked out pretty well for me.  

Her method was a just-in-time type of deal instead of a stay-on-top of things deal.  She'd wash clothes to get us through the next few days, while the rest stayed on bedroom floors dirty.  She'd wash the dishes she needed for what she was going to cook the next day or two.  The rest stayed dirty on the counter.  I knew she wasn't the tidiest when dating, but I didn't realized it would be that bad.  I'd get frustrated and use a snow shovel to push everything into a big pile in the living room and then sort through it all.  Anyway, it's a long story how we worked through that... 

The spending was mostly just that she got accustomed to the lifestyle her parents provided and wasn't able to downshift during the period she was on her own before me or down to what we could afford as a family on just my salary.  Her net worth was close to $0 when we got married even though her parents had completely paid for her college and bailed her out everytime she needed a little money for something like a car repair.

The argument provided is insufficient for the extrapolation as well.  For the sake of argument let's agree with her statement, whereby she suggests that a monarch at some stage in history caused a procedure easing the process of labour to be impeded in some way.  She's got a long way to go to reach the level of “men are the cause of the world's problems”.  At best, what she's got is a perspective to show that at some stage a king did something barbaric that has likely (assuming it's true) been accounted for and corrected nowadays in the medical community, and is no longer a factor in the world.  Meaning her argument doesn't even fit in a modern context.  The problem she's presenting is gone.  Historically, maybe it existed, but it's hardly one of the world's problems.

Further, in essence, what she's said is: “A bad thing happened a while ago because of the lunacy of a man.”  And I'd just point out that the gender of this person doesn't seem relevant and ought to be omitted from the perspective.  It seems to me that the more interesting and important thing to address is the sadism and cruelty on display by such an individual.  And to criticise the political landscape that arises within a monarchic system.  Go off into the more substantive territory.

If she wants to ‘die on the hill' of citing the gender of the psychologically ill individual, who did what she claimed, as the causal factor, she's going to need to provide an argument for why that was a factor, rather than reciting 1 historic account.

Essentially, a counterpoint need not be raised due to the fact that she has no argument in the first place.  As explained, at best, she's got an example of the hideousness of monarchy and dictatorships.  Gender doesn't factor into this narrative aside from the gender of the ruler.  She's inviting us to believe (as she likely does), and presupposing, that the king's gender is an important factor in this story, when there's nothing in its content (that which comprises her argument) that would suggest that.  She needs an accurate argument with references to things that support her claim.  Otherwise, she's essentially just said: “I'm not a very sophisticated or intelligent person, and I don't like males.”  Which is a lot of what people like this tend to say when you boil their logic down and strip away the superficial elements.

People who make broad and character-based assumptions claims about massive amounts of human beings make logic errors constantly.  They require you to skip over these finer details because if you do, you won't realise how poor constricted it all is, and you'll just react to the premise.",t3_z52hjr

The division of labor self-optimzed as humanity struggled in the dirt to live another day.

It's not entirely accurate. While he did enjoy watching women in that position give birth, it was François Mariceau that we believe currently to have influenced that change. From the late 1500's onward, birthing lying on your back became popular as reclining bed birthing was comfortable for women, and accessible for midwives and surgeons.

ixv4sgu,t1_ixup30d,"Look, I want to be straight with you. Advocacy for men's rights is important but I suggest you look at both sides. Your sister is being extreme and there is much more balance to find than in this sub. I will explain to you why what she says is flawed but also what the others in the sub are explaining is flawed too.

A. Your sister is being very dismissive of individuality. Yes men have historically abused their power and it was wrong. Yes there are effects from that that ought to be SOMEWHAT corrected but no it is not all mens fault and no it is not because they have penises. It is because men are biolligically stronger and humans suck in general and abuse power in general. So the biollogically stronger gender abused and did not permit equality historically. Wouldve been the same in case women had that strenght. And men = women period. No doubt about that. Equality. Men nowadays in current societies are not abusing that power in general. so it is not ok to generalize like that. It is polarizing and wrong.

B. Saying men built everything is a symptom of inequality in part so that is a flawed argument. Women werw not allowed to have an education till very very late yet men did. Obviously more educated people will contributw to progress more. So it is a symptom of inequality and just helping her prove her point.  The division of labor can make sense somewhat biologically the problem is when women's work at home cannot be remunerated by financial profit in a market society. And therefore they have no economic independence and are subject to potential abuse or difference in power in a relationship. So now there is education and ebcouragement for women to pursue it. That is fair and ofc it is a slow process but we cannot ignore the symtpoms of inequality towards women just because we acknowledge the unequal bad treatment and abuse towards men too.

C. Men have it hard too in other senses so one should stop dismmissing men's issues.  Advocating for men's issues and problems does not mean ignoring and dismissing women's problems due to inwquality and making it a petty contest of who is stronger or better. If she falling into that try being much more mature.",t3_z52hjr
ixv127k,t1_ixurs8r,"Couple of questions about things that, to me, seem antithetical to what you've just put forward.

1) If societal pressures exist keeping women out of certain fields, why were women able to make in roads into medicine? Most trainee doctors are now women in the west, and in many countries, most doctors, despite the opposite initially where they were all men. What's different about medicine that allowed them to overcome this? Surely men would just keep them out of this lucrative field?


2) If it's true that societal pressures cause this, why do countries that have done the most to combat these societal pressures have the least amount of parity when it comes to job roles? For example, there is greater representation of women in STEM in Iran  than there is in any Scandanavian country, who are praised for there progressive policies involvong gender representation?

I disagree with you and those that pose views like your, obviously, but that's because these realities seem contrary to what you've proposed. I've never seen a convincing argument that would explain how these phenomena can exost while simultaneously allowing for the the societal pressures you purport to be large enough to have an impact.

University education has become more linked to that in the last 50 to 100 years, but that's the time frame that women have entered heavily into the education system.  And even with them being an absolute majority of graduates, they still lag in STEM.

So don't push that one too much please.",t3_z52hjr
ixzv9vt,t1_ixv4sgu,"You claim to want to be ""reasonable"" yet base your narrative on stupid (factually incorrect & misandrist) feminist talking points.

1. ""Men"" did not ""historically abuse their power"", because ""men"" as a group never had any ""power"" over women. You could cite certain institutions like the Church or what have you. Fair enough. But that wasn't relevant in the day to day lives of men & women struggling to get by & working as a team to survive. You basically argue that gender roles are a ""male"" construction, put in place because ""men"" abused their so called ""power"" to privilege their own. WRONG. These ""oppressive"" gender roles were all biologically motivated & they're what ensured the survival of the species for thousands of years. But I guess male animals ""abuse"" their ""power"" too because most of them (mammels at least) have the same structure? What a joke.
2. Men did not build everything because ""women were kept out"". This assumes that there was ever a time when education & the so called ""workplace"" (which didn't exist until the 20th century, you people seriously need to read history) were initially ""open"" to women & that ""at a certain point, men took over & excluded all the women"". Yeah that never happened. Men built ALL of these institutions on their own. ""Men not allowing women to participate"" was as logical to them at that time as women not allowing men to be in female spaces like restrooms. Does society benifit when women are allowed to participate? Of course, but this idea that it was because ""men took over these spaces"" is absurd. NO ONE stopped women - at any point throughout history - to build their own spaces. But they never did. And to claim that the reason women didn't ""contribute"" on an equal level is because of the ""discrimination"" they faced is absurd. I already addressed this stupid claim. First of all, there were plenty of female scientists & engineers throughout all of history, proving that women were very much able to contribute if they truly desired... but more importantly, TODAY, women have ALL the same opportunities. They in fact have special treatments & get preferential hiring in STEM fields. Guess what? Basically ALL of today's inventions & critical contributions to society ARE STILL delivered by MEN. In other words, on a societal level, it doesn't even matter if ""women are given the opportunity"" because they clearly don't make use of it. Women would rather do gender fucking studies than actually contribute meaningfully to society. And that's their choice. More power to them. But then they also don't get to play the gender card when men like me call them out & say that everything you see around you is built & maintained by men.
3. This whole ""unpaid labor (at home)"" narrative is a bad joke. The idea that doing some loundry whilst watching a movie with a glass of wine could, let alone SHOULD, be compared to breaking your back on a twelve hour shift at work is fucking laughable. Do men get compensated for the work they do at home? Of course not and no one even THINKS to ""correct"" that either. You say this like women are forced into being stay at home wives, or as if this role is one of ""oppression"" (like really, living off of your husband's earnings whilst you do fuck all beyond a few trivial tasks like ""cleaning the home"" or ""doing the laundry"" is objectively the furthest thing away from a life of ""oppression"")... Oh wait, women have EVERY OPPORTUNITY (and in fact, more so than men) to participate in the workplace, attend higher education, and do anything they want. But on the whole, they still don't do it as much as men. That's not ""male privilege"", that's female choice. 
4. It's funny you mention that because you failed to raise a single legitimate female issue. You cited a bunch of feminist horseshit & then called it a day whilst pretending you're more enlightened than the others on this sub. What a joke.",t3_z52hjr

Men r stuck w the responsibility no matter if they even wanted the child or not. Ur stupidity is astonishing.",t3_z52hjr
ixx3cbt,t1_ixwfuxe,"Okay let's play out these hypotheticals then…

1. Woman gets pregnant. Neither party wants baby. Woman aborts. Everyone wins except for the baby.
2. Woman gets pregnant. Doesn't want baby. Man wants baby. Woman aborts. Fucked up because the man wanted a child and would have supported it. 
3. Woman gets pregnant. Doesn't want baby. Man wants baby. Woman forced to birth baby. Fucked up because you are taking away someone's bodily autonomy.
4. Woman gets pregnant. Wants baby. Man doesn't want baby. Woman forced to abort. Fucked up re: bodily autonomy. 
5. Woman gets pregnant. Wants baby. Man doesn't want baby. Woman births baby. Man has to pay child support. Also fucked up.
6. Woman gets pregnant. Wants baby. Man wants baby. Woman births baby. Happy ending for all parties. 

In the scenario in which you are talking about a woman can choose to keep the baby if she wants but the man didn't want it and now he has to pay child support… the alternative is forcing her to abort. And I know you'll say that at least she has a choice but that difference in choice between a man and a woman is the difference between one's bodily autonomy and one's paying child support. 

So how is that not complicated??",t3_z52hjr

A woman maybe DOESNT want a child but the father does?

Take the new phrase ""he doesn't meet my standards"" and news even running with that theory (men need to do better, get dating skills etc, Psych today article for example).

Whilst it is her decision what she does with her own body, the current laws force negative consequences on other people for her ""sole"" decision, without any choice in the matter and she, and other women like her, don't care because they are getting what they want. It's basically supporting selfishness and the principle of ""F U I got mine"".

Equal rights means a right to bodily sovereignty and consent required to use another persons tissues.

The OP is young enough to experience raising a child in the future if he wants and gives his consent. The Mother has just brought a child into the world to be raised under the difficulties of single parenthood, when raising children requires 2 parents, simply for her own selfish reasons and expecting to force the OP to contribute to her sole decision.

So I thought it would be easier to find an apartment that was basically 10-15 minutes away by foot from the uni I went to. And yes, they all basically wanted women.

This constant back and fourth creates a kind of tension which is not ideal for ones mental health if it continues over a longer period of time without any meaningfull brakes.

Lastly, yes, there is real risk living with a man. Any stranger who lives with you can be dangerous, but woman on woman rape is pretty rare, and if she's violent, the woman will have a much better chance of defending herself. Similarly, a male looking for a roommate might want a male roommate for privacy reasons or because he wants to eliminate the risk of a false allegation.

18 years old I am,  and never been sexually harassed once, and at the same time my girlfriend, the same age as me has been several times. And sexual harassment is one of the harsher ways, subtler misogyny goes deeper. 

I'm not disregarding the fact that men don't get sexually harassed or aren't having any issues, I'm sure you've heard of the man up bullshit and especially, in countries like mine, while a girl is expected to do all of the chores in a household while staying at home, a guy is expected to earn lots of money, often to unrealistic extents. Not hard to see that it hurts both sides :) , I'm against anyone disregarding anyone else's struggles, a lot of women struggle coz of the patriarchy, and I'm sure it'd do both them and us good to accept the fact and hope to change. 

Honestly it's hard to discuss views of both sides just coz how polarised these subreddits are. I've seen instances where in women's subreddits men's struggles are disregarded, one was in the fourthwavewomen subreddit where a woman commented ""women's loneliness is real loneliness, men are just horny"" and tons upvotes. While at the same time, i find your comment here outright stating that the majority of women are emotionally abusive :D 

do these people realise that they are being just as bad as long as they stay polarised like this?

The psychology of hate

Years back, in another life, I presented at seminars and conferences that provided continuing education units for professional re-certification. In one particular module, I used a portable grease board in a room in front of my waiting audience. Without introducing myself or saying anything else, I used a grease pen to write the words ""Men are..."" at the top of the board, and then silently invited the audience to finish the sentence.

Almost invariably, ""pigs"" or ""dogs"" was the first offering, accompanied by a room full of good-natured chuckles. I would nod my head and write it down on the board and return to the audience, still silent, for more.

""Controlling,"" says one. ""Afraid of commitment,"" says another. ""Aggressive."" ""Macho"" ""Afraid of intimacy."" ""Violent."" ""Sexist,"" and ""Power hungry."" More of the pejoratives, and almost only pejoratives, would come from the audience till the board was full.

I then flipped the board to the other side. ""Women are..."" was the cue, and the answers were even more rapid fire than they were with men. ""Strong."" ""Capable"" ""Empowered"" ""Sensitive."" ""Nurturing,"" and the like would fly from the audience to the grease board like a barrage of arrows, till that side too was full.

""What do you imagine,"" I would ask, taking a strategic pause for a sip of water, ""that these answers tell us about the real nature of sexism in the way we view men and women?""

Asking them a question with actual spoken words must of thrown them for a loop, because the stock response to that question was almost invariably a room full of nonplussed, cognitively dissonant faces. And that confusion usually gave way to irritation, clearly at me, though every answer on both sides of that board had come from them. And by the way, the participants in the crowd? They weren't accountants or nurses or teachers or financial advisors.

They were mental health professionals.

They were counselors, psychotherapists, social workers and the like; the very people we love to imagine possess the objectivity to rise above the mindset of bigotry and sexism. And the people, despite our want of faith in their work, least likely to actually do it.

I wanted a little more pressure so I asked more questions. ""How could this affect our therapeutic alliance with clients?- Could it make our relationships with females enabling?- Punitive with men?"" And always, the final question I asked was ""Do we carry sexism, against men, unconscious or conscious, into our work with each and every client?"" With that question the anger usually intensified.

In one talk, a female participant, a social worker, jumped out of her chair and threw her papers everywhere. ""You're the sexist!"" she hissed at me, and stormed out of the room. She later wrote letters of complaint both about my topic and the fact I would not sign off on her attendance.",t3_z5bf3v

He asked for a lawyer during a very difficult and intense interrogation by the Fort Worth Police Department and I shit you not, they told him “Unable to comply” real matter of factly and when he tried to leave, they used physical force on him to prevent him from leaving (I'm not kidding). His trial lasted about five weeks and the prosecution called over six dozen witnesses and they made so many slanderous and incorrect allegations about his overall character and his own mother even threw him under the bus. He testified on his own behalf and he stupidly said that one of the questions was not a yes or no question and the judge held him in contempt of court. He wasn't being a wiseass, he was just beyond shocked and flustered that he knew he was legally and factually innocent and what's worse is there were ten women on the jury and two soy boys who were the other jurors. BTW I was a spectator in the courtroom as I knew in my heart that he was totally innocent. The jury took just 75 minutes to find him guilty of aggravated physical and sexual assault of minor under the age of 18, contributing to the delinquency of a minor, making a fraudulent statement about the victim. He was sentenced to 75 years in prison with a chance of parole after 50 years. He spent over a dozen years in prison for a crime he didn't commit. DNA evidence excluded him from all the crimes he was convicted of. He has gone full blown no contact with those who doubted his claims of innocence and his own son said that the exculpatory evidence didn't matter as he still believes the woman who made the claim as he insists that she never lied about anything.

In my case she was a good friend and even my confident. I could talk about anything to her, even matters of the heart (I had had a huge heartbreak months before and she was the one who helped me get better). I was 22 at the time and she was around 34.
I started having feelings for her, but didn't really realize it. One evening I'm at her place and she tells me she has feelings for me, so I tell her I have too. We just spent time hugging eachother and I once showed I wanted to kiss her. Obviously she didn't want as she was already in a relationship, which I totally understood. Later in the evening, after she had initially told me I could stay sleep on the couch, she asked me to leave because she was scared of what she might do during the night (wanted to remain faithful to her partner).
I told her it wasn't a problem as I have a very high self control and wouldn't allow anything to happen, but that I would leave if she preferred, so I ended up leaving.

After that evening, we decided nothing would be ever said and that we would continue our friendship as before, which did continue for a few months in until I left town for work.

Fast forward 5 months later, I come back and find her avoiding me (we where usually seeing eachother at a martial arts class). I stopped going to the class for various reasons and two months later we got COVID lockdowns. I sent her an email asking if everything was ok for her. Her answer was a full list of accusations listed as bullet points: that I had manipulated her and tried to take advantage of her, that she had to force me to leave on that famous evening, that I was selfish and didn't care about people, etc... 
Despite my frustration, boiling blood and sadness, I replied to every points she had made, explaining my point of view. She never answered, and continued to avoid me in class or at other events with my martial art group.

I remember at the time, being so sad and desperate, not understanding why she would even think something like that, and at the same time, my fighting spirit lit up and I was thinking ""you better not even try to accuse me publicly or I'm going to destroy you"" (I had email and texts proofs that we where still good friends after that evening).

Granted, it's not Chicago, but Chicago is a lot bigger too. Per capita, most US cities are safer, except the really bad ones like Chicago, Detroit, Minneapolis, etc.  
The US is generally more diverse. The bad neighborhoods are REALLY bad, and the good ones are really good. The suburbs and small towns in the US are totally safe. If you stay out of Compton and Riverside, even LA is quite safe, too. But the statistics are impacted by those few high crime areas.  


Singapore, I'm not too familiar with, I only know what people told me. Generally it's a very strict place. Expensive, too. Spitting on the street will get you arrested. I imagine with a sizeable islamic population, they probably won't have full freedom of speech.

Essentially, these women asked for a belief system, a label they could attach themselves to, that would embody their belief in equality without demonizing men.Some of these women stuck around and proudly call themselves MRAs.  More of them stuck around but balked at calling themselves MRAs.  And a lot of newcomer women tend to see a lot of unmasked anger, and get scared off.  Which of course leads to calls for moderation, which isn't going to happen…""

The writer is either being disingenuous or unaware of fairly recent history. In the hardly ancient past, women who were eager to not simply declare ""I'm an anti-feminist!!!""(which is pretty much the extent of most female MRAs's activism), but to actually agitate politically for causes like making shared parenting legislation the law of the land were showing up at rallies in droves [https://reason.com/1994/07/01/man-troubles/](https://reason.com/1994/07/01/man-troubles/) The philosophical difference between this earlier movement, as exemplified by barbarically under-remembered advocates like Asa Baber ( ""Basic fairness is not the only reason for women to work on behalf of men's issues. Perhaps the ultimate lesson we have still to learn is that most gender issues are women's and men's issues. As Brott says, ""You can't achieve the goals of sexual equality without getting men involved."" The most obvious example of this is the issue of parenthood: Greater male involvement in child rearing is essential if women's opportunities in the workplace are to be expanded.Men and women of good will working together is a theme Playboy's Asa Baber frequently emphasizes. ""What is needed is an equal rights movement, not a men's movement and a women's movement,"" he told the Chicago Men's Conference, which had a record number of women this year (about 30 out of 200 attendees). ""Not men's rights, not women's rights—equal rights. That should be our goal.""  Baber is encouraged by signs that ""victim feminism"" is waning, and he is confident that ""victim masculism"" will not prevail either: ""As the complaints build, we're going to get tired of it, both sides, and then both men and women are going to ask, OK, now what are we gonna do? And so the culture of complaint will eventually burn itself out."")and the terrific James Cook ( [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=101833696](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=101833696) )made this sort of coalition building possible

By contrast, The MRM as it's existed from the mid-10s through today has prioritized catharsis/endlessly caterwauling over all the shit that isn't going our way over asking ""What are our goals, and what actions are we taking to achieve those goals?"" This didn't just drive away women who'd otherwise be inclined to help, but most men who are more interested in taking action than they are remaining locked in a never-ending groan fest. We could greatly benefit from a return to the sort of activism that earlier, successful advocates like Baber, Arst, Kammer, and Cook practiced

It's not necessary for women to-as some prominent MRAs propose-first ""recognize all the ways they benefit from gynocentrism"", or to regularly proclaim ""I'm an anti-feminist!!!"" in public, BEFORE they can be of service. Subjects like making shared parenting legislation the law of the land, ending a Drug War which disproportionately locks up men, abolishing most forms of welfare in favor of putting recipients into legit work, and providing greater access to vocational training than currently exists aren't gendered problems, in the grand scheme of things. They're American problems, the likes of which invite the attention and energies of all who want to provide their/our descendants with a saner world than the one we inherited",t3_z5l3av

ixxkkk3,t3_z5mlvv,"I (36f) was a stay at home parent for years.  When we started dating we were both young professionals in the legal field. 

I never wanted to be a stay at home parent. I wanted a career, and to get out and do things. My husband (37m) was in a better position, through his education and actual job to provide for us. 

We figured out the cost of childcare, lunches, gas etc, and determined that we would have more money if I stayed home than if I worked. 

When the youngest started school, I went back to work, by our mutual agreement. I am working to restart my career, and ""catch up"" to where I thought I would be. 

I appreciate everything my husband sacrificed so that I could stay home with our babies through their early childhood. 

He appreciates what I gave up, and everything I did to keep our home running, kids healthy, and all the home tasks that I routinely handled so he could focus on growing his business and providing for us. 

I think its something each couple has to navigate. What works for some, wouldn't work for everyone. This kind of arrangement only works when both parties are really focused on working together to create the life they want. 
I took my position as a stay at home parent seriously. I made his lunch most of the time, unless he has a work lunch or meeting planned, I made sure dinner was hot, and the house was kept so that he could come home eat, rest, and play with our kids. He still took on home reno projects, and any number of tasks to ease our way.

He will find himself in a 1 bdrm apartment, without his kids, nobody to clean his house or fix his dinner but still have to pay, working double so she can stay home.

That doesn't make these suggestions of her 'not stupid' though, trying to age restrict guns in the US is just never going to work. There really is no way to restrict goods or services to some people while those same goods and services are legal and easily attainable to other people. The sheer amount of firearms in the US makes it near impossible to have any kind of regulation on the firearms themselves.

I don't believe that these people are that stupid, i believe that this is ""American propaganda"" targeted at the American market. I'm using the term 'propaganda' quite loosely here, meaning it isn't that the US government is doing this but rather American arms manufacturers lobby. They are the ones who are 'egging on' both 'sides' of this argument, as they've learned a long time ago that by screaming on both sides of an argument they get to be the ones who are controlling the narrative.

The 'anti-gun' lobby doesn't want to remove or limit firearms, just look at their completely idiotic idea's to 'ban' them. All of their idea's are basically based on loony-toon logic, age restrictions, banning of some type of gun (as if that is going to help), gun-shows (making it harder to sell a gun second hand means more guns to sell new). None of these will restrict gun sales or prevent ill willed people from getting and using a gun. Why come up with all these stupid idea's that can not ever work, but do rile up the people that want guns, to buy more of them?

If they really want to lower gun violence why don't they go after the ammunition? I mean it is the bullets that make guns dangerous and without bullets there isn't much you can do with a gun. It seems very obvious to me that if you want to curb gun use in the US the only way to go is to limit the ammunition. Once they are spend they are spend and you have to buy or make new ammunition. While ammo can be made by yourself, it isn't exactly easy, specially if you can't buy empty shells or caps any more.

The DIY scene of making ammunition isn't that big so that can be easily curbed very quickly. All they need to do after that is to raise the tax on ammunition by a shit ton and wait. Before too long most of the cheap available ammunition will be spend and then it will become much harder for young people or einzelgängers to obtain large amounts of ammunition.

When a feminist makes the claim that women have it worse, inevitably the only proof they have is that bad things happen to women. That's not proof that women have it worse. They need to show that men don't have worse things happening to them.

Most men, like you, don't have issues with women as whole. They may have an issue with one person who happens to be a woman but they will not judge a whole gender based on the actions of one. This is critical thinking as you know, and are very painfully aware of its conflict with one minded thinking. 

I often say be the change you want to see in the world, you want all people to be treated well and equal then you must be the one who does it and dam what others might do. I feel people should be more polite to each other and show decent human respect, so I do that. Not everyone agrees, so not everyone will reciprocate; thats not my problem. 

I can only change behaviors of myself. Yes you can help someone change their mind but that is only if their mind is open to change, and open to seeing how the world really is. if they are capable of critical thinking, if they are capable of thinking past their own person and empathy of another, then it is more likely you can change their perceptions.  as I said this change of perception must be accepted by the person before you are able to show them how to look in a different direction. 

I don't know you, and I don't know your girlfriend so I can't tell you if her perception will change or get worse, but be prepared that she might get worse and not change. I know that is hard to hear, more so if it is someone we love very much; I have had to endure the same thing, twice in my life. Once a girlfriend hated black people; it devastated me she was this way. Another was so lovely but she hated gays.. again, I don't want hate in my life. 

This is not something people commenting to you on reddit can help you with, but it is something that you will have to deal with in the future, a fundamental part of a relationship is values and communication. Liking the same music and food is great, but many people like the same things as you, do they have the same values?

Is she someone who might see beyond the things she sees on twitter and the like to se the reality in front of her?  what is more important here heart, or these falsehoods?  

I don't want you to hate her, or be mad at her for these things, be mad at what caused them. Any one can fall pray to this kind of stuff, as you have seen, she is someone important to you and she matters to you and that is good!  However, once someone has gone too far it is often hard to pull them back, and you could waste a lot of yourself trying to do so. I think that is the caution that you are being told here by many, I am no different.

This isn't really that different.  If she ever had your child, just imagine the crap she'd want to teach your child.  

Anyways, you really should be treating this like a religious difference, b/c aside from having a structure like a church, it's not that different.  Using reason/argument will never cause her to change her mind.  

She will only change her mind if, on some level, she starts to be emotionally affected by something that challenges her views.  I have seen married feminist types look at their partner and be absolutely shocked by some of their partner's life experiences.  It does happen, but coming from a Jehovah's witness background myself, it is far more likely for her to waffle on that, take forever and waste your life, before *maybe* changing her viewpoint to something more paletable.

If she is a “TERF”, then my advice may not help, if not though, even if you guys just believe people can do whatever they want, I think this would help. In a nutshell, try to reframe the conversation around the concept of gender itself, rather than “us v. them” defensiveness. In my experience, defending men is only read as “attacking women” or, at least, recusing ALL men by feminists (meaning they'll focus on the ones they have dirt on to undermine your argument). 

In other words, question what it is about the general state of “men” that makes them so bad in her eyes. Ask her what is so wrong about men. Then when she responds, ask how those behaviors/perspectives come to be. Most of the time, there is a direct parallel in women's behavior too, and that can't go unignored. So the question ALL of my critiques of misandrists cloaked as “feminists” is: what, aside from biology, is so different between men and women? Wasn't mere association of biological conditions to social behavior the fundamental logic of racism? Furthermore, if I, as a man, am willing to meet you, as a woman, with respect and trust that you are a rational actor, not a “silly woman”, trying to understand your behavior by understanding what you got through, listening; shouldn't you also respect, trust, and listen to understand, since you haven't loved as a man? Are you (the feminist that tells me my “kind” is wrong) willing to admit you don't fully understand me for the sake of integrity?

However, unlike other commenters, I'm not as pessimistic, but changing her mind will be tough. You will first have to get her to take a step back, out of her echo chamber. Then she might be more receptive to the men's issues you're talking about to her.
I don't know her personality. Maybe try to be upfront with her and ask her directly to stop reading about feminism and her echo chamber for a full month or two, and to take that time to research and learn about men's issues. Tell her it's important for you. If your relationship is important to her she should do it. What is one month? It's not asking for that much sacrifice.

Classic feminist: can't make a reasoned argument, because your ideology is based entirely on feelings.

You just put yourself into the same category with your NPC-like simple & predictable responses.

I didn't disagree that it was bad, or even that it was a form of sexual assault - I only disagreed that it should have the same legal punishment as forcing someone to have sex with you. On another occasion a friend I got along very well with posted about domestic violence, making the typical assertion that it's an issue of men beating women. I sent her a private message with a link to an academic article in the Journal of Domestic Abuse saying that men make up between 40% - 60% of victims depending on the study, and she responded by saying that we could no longer be friends because she doesn't feel safe around me any more.",t3_z5r0kh

A woman should never shout at her man, unless they are distance apart searching for each other and he can't hear her. Women are supposed to respect their men. Men know respect, they don't need to be told twice.

2. If you are getting tense, you'll be less able to relax, remind her that she should mind her tone and be careful how she talks to you.

A woman should always track her tone of voice when talking to her man, so she avoids accidental notes of tone that may sound rude. If she is emotional, she must avoid irritability towards him. Also talking back to the man is off limits and such disrespect. 

3. Yeah right ""assess all aspects to her words"", they are already assessed. Results: Blatant disrespect, Super talking back, unthinkable rude tone of voice.

I am ashamed as a woman that there are women with such blatant attitude against their men. 

4. No, take action and don't tolerate rudeness and disrespect.

5. It's not your responsibility to extinguish her ""rage"". It's her responsibility to be careful how she talks to you and behave herself.

6. You've already shown her you know your responsibilities. Her ungrateful ass is the one irresponsible. Such a shame.

Nobody will respect you unless you ask for it or just leave people or places where you are not treated how you deserve to be treated.

I left her after some months given the fact that she kept repeating the same behaviour, I gave her many chances but it kept happening so it was better that we continue on different paths far from each other.

As you can imagine I was a bad man because God forbids a man that decides to brake up with a women, that man is the offspring of Satan and should bw forbidden from inhabiting earth inmediately. 

Only a women can end up a relationship with a man, then it's ok and acceptable.

So to my fellow men, don't take shit from any woman, there's no excuse for verbal agression, you can find another woman in no time that is respectfull and considerate to you as long as you are the same to her.

Still my fault i was yelling.

Of course walking away from the argument only made her get angrier and more abusive, and she even left me stranded for hours a few times, including locking me out of the house in the dead of winter when i walked away.

 >Domestic violence against men is violence or other physical abuse towards men in a domestic setting, such as in marriage or cohabitation. As with domestic violence against women, violence against men may constitute a crime, but laws vary between jurisdictions. Men who report domestic violence can face social stigma regarding their perceived lack of machismo or other denigrations of their masculinity. : 6  Additionally, intimate partner violence (IPV) against men is generally less recognized by society than intimate partner violence against women, which can act as a further block to men reporting their situation.

Here's another, type in ""marriage is a scam"" into Google. The VAST majority of people searching this would be male - as men are the ones most fucked over by marriage. Yet the results are all pro female.

I like the point they make about listening. Often we get caught up, angry and don't listen, while, even if shouting is not a good way to do it, the person might express what is the cause of their frustration. In the end, its not a matter of who was right or wrong to start shouting, but of dealing with the root cause of their frustration. Of course it would be better if they just communicated openly without shouting, and they should work on themselves, but them shouting is not a reason to stop listening to what they have to say.

She deleted you after a bad sexual experience because she knows she won't hook up with you again. 99% nothing will happen.   If it does... keep all texts as evidence.

ixywl01,t3_z5v03r,"Two things go through my head when I read posts like this.

First, as a Black man, my response to feminists (usually white) who spout this stuff is to tell them that I agree with them and, for similar reasons, I limit my contact with white women. Historically, white women have weaponized their gender & white skin privilege to falsely accuse Black men of sexual assaults which have resulted in lynchings, executions, and massacres. And, this isn't something that happened 100 years ago. In the recent past we had the BBQ Karen calling cops on Black men BBQ'ing and Central Park Karen calling cops on a Black male birdwatcher who asked her to put her dog on a leash. When I was in college, a friend of mine was picked up by a white female student who had a history of getting drunk and bringing men back to her apartment. This time, though, she woke up with a Black man in her bed and decided to call the cops and claim she'd been raped because she was too drunk to give consent. My friend was kicked out of school and went to prison.

They usually become uncomfortable and say something along the lines of “not all white women” to which I reply that it may not be all white women but, since I can't tell which white women may potentially put me in danger, I limit my contact with all white women unless I specifically have to.

Second, when it comes to sexual assaults, we've recently started to hear stories about women sexually preying on male children but what isn't discussed is the long history of this and how society has responded to it. Where female victims of this sexual predation are given sympathy, male victims are told that they should be happy for the experience and that it's a sign of their powerful sexuality that an adult woman couldn't resist having sex with them. These female sexual predators, even if known in the community, are rarely reported to law enforcement and young males may simply be warned to stay away from them. The fact that they aren't reported means that the statistics on this type of sexual assault so not accurately reflect reality. 

And, let's not even begin discussing women sexually preying on other girls and women. Another topic that feminists are uncomfortable even talk about.

Sexual victimization is a complex issue but, unfortunately, it hasn't been adequacy addressed because of misandrist attitudes that largely ignore or downplay female perpetrators of sexual assault.

With the statistics however I agree we blokes are more murderous but even her reasoning for why that's the case is probably stupid. Most yanks that are male kill from violent towards gangs. Which is a mainly male dominated filled however it's primarily due to the facts of lack of work, pressure, criminal record (Which fuck a lot of Yanks). Not to mention most believe men should provide for their family and help them get in relationships at that.

So of course most of her statistics (While pulled out her ass) are centred on that prime reason men are stereotyped into the bread makers. With feminism being at some point wanting to change that nowadays most girls either like the idea of this or want someone who earns more.

Plus on the rape topic, I know more guys who been accused of sex crimes and been raped. Not saying the type reverse shit, but guys don't also like coming out about shit that makes us weak. Dent in our armour which can be used as a form of bullying.

they are right that most violent crimes are done by men altho leaving out the fact that a majority of victims of violent crimes (except sexual aggression) are men too

acting like men don't know men are violent and are offended when u tell them they are is delusional, they are offended cus most friends of any guys are not violent rapists

the stat they used proves this lol
the US has more than 300 000 000 ppl (let's half it for the population of men)
in 2020 8,977 murders were commited by men
lets give it like 20 000 to account for the unsolved and then some 

after some calculations [(20 000-150000000)/150000000]*100

u find out that 99,987% of men didn't kill that year (and thas not even accurate)

u can do this for rapes as well, theres prolly some overlap between perpetrators so u can adjust for that

(granted this is just a stat pulled out of a comment from a screenshot lol)

>Steven F. Messner and Robert J. Sampson decided to take a closer look at the numbers behind the statistics of violence. They approached the issue by testing a simple hypothesis: If men are more violent than women, we should see more acts of violence in communities that have a larger male population compared to a female population. But their findings proved differently.  
>  
>Messner and Sampson discovered that the rate of violent crime was higher in communities that had more females than males. This meant a larger percentage of men in these communities committed acts of violence than men in communities with a more balanced ratio of men to women. Why would that be?  
>  
>They suggested a few ideas that might explain this trend. One is that in communities that have more women than men, there are more cases of disruption in families. That means that there are more single-parent families -- usually families with no father. Messner and Sampson suggest that the lack of a stable family environment contributes to a culture of crime and violence, though they say that other factors are also important

Sadly i cant find a valid source on what percentage of men commit murder or rape. because if for example 10% percent men are the ones that commit them then you cant say that men are the natural predators and still if the Quora user is right and say max if 40% of men commit rape, not spesificaly againts women, there is still 60% of people that you cant ignore and say all men. oh right now i am getting mad cause i might be realizing she might not be able to either think or read basic english or doesnt know what statistics mean she says 98% of the total homocide are men and 99% of rapist are men and she takes that to say that #NOTALLMEN is bullshit bruh she has no logic, it might be lets say 100 people that commit the total murders are 100 98 of them where commited by 98 men and 2 by 2 women, bet they used poison \*joking a bit\*, the statistics didnt change still 98% of murders where commited by men but it was only 98 men that did them there are some billion more men that you cant blame. ***sorry i dont want to be mansplaining common sense***

These carriers of parasitic-darkness are fundamentally a different breed, they do not think nor feel like normal human beings. Their natural human life giving polarity having been inverted into a life stealing and taking polarity.

There are *just as many* female predators as their are male.

Good men AND good women suffer at the hands and machinations of these human monsters.

But that there is a popular narrative... That good and decent women are falling prey to.... That equates normal and good and loving men, with those wrong kind of monster - parasitic and predatory men... Is galling, is mind boggling!?!?????!!

And while I can understand that the feminine/female is naturally more receptive, which makes them easier to indoctrinate in some ways, and also means they imprint trauma that bit more deeply...

Still there is NO defence for good women buying into this BULLSHIT and lumping normal and good men in with such predators..

I call out men likewise when they do a version of ""all women are narcisisists""

There are good men AND good women out there, and we need to come back together and become educated about these monsters that camouflage themselves to hide among and abuse and harm us all...

Studying up on narcisism and covert narcisism extensively is a baseline starting point.

So, by spreading that logical error that you have to be careful for all men is just putting women in danger: iso turning to men if they find themselves in a bad situation and ask for help, the women will isolate herself, which is exactly what will put her in danger, it is much better to turn to people who are around whatever if they are men or women.
5. To get a feeling of how abnormal these 0.12% rapists are: their neurological impaired inner brain, makes the loop for action-reaction-consequences doesn't function. Any normal person would immediately consider: yes, but this girl has a father, brothers, uncles, boyfriends ... they are going to come after me and kill me! So I better don't rape that girl.  That's how malfunctioning are their brains they just skip that.  There's reddits here where you can see beat downs of such rapists and sexual abusers.  Because of that handicapped brain, these 0.12% rapists of course don't stop at rape, they do all kind of criminality and hence they have a criminal record.

iy1w45b,t3_z5v03r,"This is to the men and boys like OP who are trying to figure things out. If you disagree with me because you have made up your mind then please move on.

I'm talking to them in a way that is like I would talk to my past 16 year old self about what I have learned since then. Possibly what I will tell my future sons, nephews and grandsons or whatever. This is also to protect my future daughters, nieces and grand-daughters. 

Not all men are rapists but at the same time a lot of men do things that harm women and girls, including rapey things. So it makes sense that women are afraid of us. I think it's useful to be mindful of that and thoughtful about how we as a gender/sex behave.

Rather than take it personally and start going ""Well what about women? They also do violence and r*pe"" we should take some personal responsibility and reflect on it. 

- Do you ever ask a girl out and when they say ""no/I have a bf/I'm not ready for a relationship"" do you go ""well you're ugly anyways, bitch!""?

- Do you think if you pay for a date that you should get a kiss/head/sex etc? And if you don't get it do you get pretty angry?

- Do you have a girl you like and you try to get close to her by being ""nice"" to her because you're interested in her and hope it will make her like you even though you never let her know you like her? Kind of acting like you're one thing (her friend) when really you wanna smash?

- Do you ever talk to your friends about how because a girl dresses more revealing or has a big butt or big boobs or does her makeup a certain way that she probably has had lots of sex before even though you have no actual evidence? Do you ever think or say well she's not gf material but she might be a good lay?

- Do you think getting a girl drunk is a good way to get in there and smash? If a girl tells/told you to stop would you stop or think that its ok?

If you do then you should stop. If you don't then that's a good start. Not sure if you think these are ok but they are not. They are the kinds of behaviors that hurt women and girls.

I think while it's ok to call out women and girls that do harm men and boys, just doing the Spiderman pointing fingers meme doesn't solve anything. To make it less about boys vs girls I will explain it as the bully (feat his crew sometimes) vs a skinny kid. Depending on our social circles we might not be able to relate to women and girls BUT many of us have experiences with a bully before. For this example let's call them Jamie but this applies to the skinny kids are a group, not just Jamies.

Jamie has gotten rough with their friends in grade school but is more chilled out now. The bully, Zack, on the other hand is a kid who is athletic, popular, and strong and has a pattern of violence and taking things too far. He also has a lot of friends that will back him up even if he lies.

- with this in mind it would make sense that you would walk faster if you see them and feel unsafe
- if you saw them bully other kids like you of course you would be scared
- you wouldn't want to be alone with them because if a fight would happen you would lose
- if you did fight him then his homies would jump in or they might lie and say you started it somehow
- they might try to convince you or others that they were just playing and ur just too soft
- maybe they play sports so the principal will try to protect them against bullying allegations or downplay it

The cards are stacked against you. And sure it isn't unheard of that a skinny Jamie who knows MMA and fucks up a Zack. That's not the norm though. That's also not you. So should people say hey well sometimes skinny kids beat up their bullies and just not change anything? Do we just hope that the bully meets an MMA Jamie and gets knocked out and learn their lesson? No. We should focus on the Zacks with a pattern of violence first rather than let them keep going while we look at each MMA Jamies individually. 

I used to be a Jamie and I knew other kids like me who were easy targets. Luckily, I'm now grown and most people I meet assume I can fight (even though I can't lol) so I don't have this problem anymore.

Let's call you Mike. If you were an athletic, popular, strong dude like Zack that played sports would you blame a Jamie if they saw you as a threat? If you wanted to befriend Jamie, I think that you should find ways to let them know that you're not a threat (and mean it). You might bond over them teaching you how to beat a boss in a video game, not just acting like their friend until you get better. They might be suspicious for a while if they saw and heard other kids get beat up by people that had your vibe. That's ok. You don't have as much trauma of being bullied so you might be ok putting in more effort and reaching out more. You might be able to do this by doing things like walking home with Jamie so they can feel more safe and Zacks will be disincentivized to start something with you around. You can break up the fights if you see it happen. If it escalates you can jump in or you could let the principal know. Likewise if you see Jamies pick on others, you would call them out.

This might be a dated explanation but this is the best I have that I have experienced.

I had a few friends like this for a while. One named Tony and the other named Jimmy. They had my back and were there for me. I look up to them for that. I learned that my job as a man is not to just do well for myself but to be there for my friends. To stand up for others who are having a hard time for as long as they need me to.

To go back to the men/women thing I try to be there for women because they are more like the Jamies of the world that are **disproportionally** more victimized. This also applies to men who are not traditionally masculine, struggle with depression, or are bullied due to their race or sexuality. As for straight, white, masculine-presenting men they already have the system working for them so they don't need my help as much.

I will provide one example since this is already long asf.
- [the Central Park Five](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Park_jogger_case#:~:text=Five%20black%20and%20Latino%20youths,inmate%20confessed%20to%20the%20crime.) (now the Exonerated Five) were Black and Latino youths convicted of assaulting the woman, and served sentences ranging from six to twelve years. All later had their charges vacated after a prison inmate confessed to the crime.
- [Brock Turner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_v._Turner), a white student on the Stanford swim team, was caught **red-handed** (by some German cyclists who passed by) while he raped a drunk passed-out woman behind a dumpster. He was sentenced to 6 months of prison and 3 years of probation. He was also initially able to post the $150,000 bail which speaks to his privilege.

Now say they aren't. (One in the room/whom said he was) They shouldn't be on the BC unless adoption (which happens!) But shouldn't be liable for child support unless he actually is given legal rights to the kid (again, adoption)

Basically men have a right to leave if the child isn't theirs, or if it is, still have an option if agreed beforehand.

The sad truth is there aren't enough personnel to really look into the ineptitude and or capabilities of parents being ""good for the kid"".

If OP was older, 20 or more, I wouldn't give the same advice. We, as adults, are the ones who should the the fighting.

Second point is that, if OP is to fight because it's his futur, there are other ways to do it rather than arguing against a stubborn wall in a sub-reddit and losing his sanity reading their posts. Make people around him aware of the issues, family, friends, research your topic and debate it at school if a teacher says something nonsense.

Women did not fight for the right to be drafted, before they could even vote.  Would you?    
Saying that, women did still play an invaluable role throughout WW2, in managing the home front and taking over with many of the men away fighting.  From 1941, women were called up for war work, in roles such as as mechanics, engineers, munitions workers, air raid wardens, bus and fire engine drivers.    


At first, only single women, aged 20-30 were called up, but by mid-1943, almost 90 per cent of single women and 80 per cent of married women were working in factories, on the land or in the armed forces.  There were over 640,000 women in the armed forces, including The Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS), the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) and the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS), plus many more who flew unarmed aircraft, drove ambulances, served as nurses and worked behind enemy lines in the European resistance in the Special Operations Executive.

Men have dominated the military and have made the rules, arguing that they don't conscript women is silly. It's also silly practically, as women can have children and men can't. I would imagine a big reason against conscription for women is that a lot of babies would be born on battlefields and it would get messy. 

Also, did you not see that Tucker Carlson piece where he railed against maternity flightsuits for women in the airforce? 

 Unfortunately, in a male run world, when men make decisions that lead to war, and men run the world's militaries, and men make the rules about whether conscription should happen and who should be conscripted, men can't then complain that women don't participate more. Women have fought for years to remove conscription completely, which would have saved the lives of a lot of men.

There are still women alive though, plenty in fact, that weren't allowed to open a bank account without a man's approval.  That only changed in 1975 with the UK Sex Discrimination Act.

No, it wasn't last week that women gained the right to vote.  However, there are many women alive today that were burdened by the oppression of women, and saw that change.

And are we really back to the old canard of not being able to open a bank account without a man's approval?  

People need to understand the difference between something being banned by law and it being ubiquitous immediately before.  

The service in pubs is a clear case.  In many places the public bar was seen as men only, and the saloon or lounge bar open to women.  But others had no restriction, and this is prior to 1982.  

I know that women had bank accounts in Australia long before 1975, and I don't think Australia was that far ahead of the curve.

The real point was that men were seen as taking the leading position in public life.  But don't make it out worse than it was.

But I'll tell you a little anecdote from a few years ago (after the benighted 20th century).  My gf took it on herself to take me to the gay pub.  That pub at the time had a bar called “the fishbowl” which was the lesbian section.  My gf though it was hilarious to drag me into it.  We got chased out as it's “women only on a Thursday”.  Now it wasn't my idea to go in.  But it seems that whilst it's illegal to refuse service to women it's quite legal to refuse service to men!",t3_z5x6zz

By your logic, all men over the age of 30 gained the right to vote in 1867, not 1918.  If the right to vote was purely determined by the conscription of the first and second world war, then why weren't women equal to men before these events?  They weren't.  In fact, women were banned from the vote in 1832 under the Reform Act, in which a voter was defined as a male person.  This occurred only 35 years before working men that owned property were given the right to vote.  No woman was given the right to vote until 86 years after the Reform Act.  Your logic makes no sense.  That is not why women were not allowed to vote.  Even it was, what's the problem with that?   Should we limit the vote for majorities, be it sex, sexuality or race, today, so they don't take up too much of the vote?

In regards to banking, nope.  It was the UK Sex Discrimination Act of 1975 that allowed women to open a bank account, to deposit the money that they themselves earned, without her husband's or male relative's permission.  A woman with a full time job could go into a bank before 1975, and be turned away if they did not have permission from their husband's, even if their husband was unemployed.   Women may have had bank accounts before 1975.  This is because their husband, brother or father approved of it.

Yes, some pubs did allow unaccompanied women to buy alcohol.  Would you be satisfied though knowing it was completely illegal to deny you service on gender alone?  Was the law okay because not everyone did deny women?  Many did.

You were thrown out because you were a man entering a lesbian area of a gay bar.  Are you going to cry oppression because you aren't allowed in a ladies bathroom too?  I presume you had no problem entering the pub itself, just using the designated part for gay women.  I would also be thrown out if I entered a part of a club, bar or pub that was exclusively for gay men.  Women were not allowed to spend their own money in a pub, and could be denied service simply because they were women.  This was any pub in the UK, denying any woman that they wanted.  If the husband bought them the drink, then it was fine.  As with the bank account situation, he was considered more important than she was.

If was made legal for any school in the country to refuse education to any young boy that they wish, purely on the basis of gender, then that is wrong.

Just as it's ok for there to be women only clubs, women only rooms on campus, women only gyms etc.  But if there's a mens only club, well it's an anachronism, a “dinosaur”, it's “oppression” and they must be forced to admit women, by force of law if necessary?

I will repeat.  Public bars in pubs (as opposed to lounge or saloon bars) were seen as a male space.  And you've admitted not all pubs had that policy either.

How would your reaction differ if in the news tomorrow, it became illegal for schools to gender discriminate against young boys and refuse them education, to young boys not being allowed in all-girls schools? Just answer that question. 

There's quite a difference there, isn't there? 

You being turned away from 1 event that was being held for lesbians, as a man, is different from women being legally refused service based on gender from all pubs and bars. You see that right?",t3_z5x6zz

I've already said how pubs and bars were not men's spaces, but I'll repeat. Women were allowed in, usually only if they were joined by their husbands. They could just be refused service if they approached the bar. Their husbands however, were fine to buy them a drink. Women being allowed in these spaces proves that it was not a “men's place”, and it was just discrimination to refuse a woman service. 

This is why it is closer to the example of it being legal to refuse one gender an education. They can walk into the school, walk around the corridors and cafeteria , but can be turned down from entering its classrooms to learn. That is wrong. That is the exact same logic as refusing women service. 

This is different to one gender not being allowed into a school designed for only the other gender, ie- an all girls or all boys school.

iy1qkaf,t1_iy1fj48,"I don't know why this is so hard for you.

Firstly, you actually previously admitted that it was not “all pubs” that discriminated against women like that.  So why are you now claiming it was?  What the law did was for bid ALL PUBS AND BARS from doing that.  And as I said, in Australia, where pubs tend to be larger, but fewer in number, there were typically two bars: the public bar and the “lounge or saloon bar” (I know this is often the case in the UK too).  Women were not allowed in the public bar in the ‘70's.  But that no longer applies.  I can't say when the change happened but I suspect it was at a very similar time to the UK legislation (perhaps slightly before or slightly after it).  

How are women being banned from the public bar different to men being banned from the Fish Bowl?  Or is it women (and particularly lesbians) having a special licence to do this?  As I said, straight women encroach on gay men's space all the time.  To the point that are often the minority at that pub - which advertises itself as our city's gay bar.",t3_z5x6zz
iy39yqy,t1_iy1qkaf,"The law gave all pubs the right to discriminate based on gender. Just because some didn't, doesn't mean that the law itself is correct, or by any means less bigoted. 

Pubs themselves were not men's spaces. The women had to remain at the table while the man ordered their drink. There is a difference between a few select venues monitoring and upholding their selected clientele, and it being okay for every single pub to discriminate on gender alone. Would you say it's acceptable if a law came in tomorrow that it's legal for a pub, club or bar to refuse service to a POC or gay person on the grounds of race or sexuality? 
Using the example of buses. It's not okay to designate a section of the bus to POC only and the rest is for white people. We have seen that in history. We cannot excuse away the actions if segregation on the grounds of “well, least they were allowed on the bus” or, “the front of the bus is just for white people”, or, “some buses were more lenient and didn't strictly follow it”. 

You see now? 

Straight women may have been over in the lesbian section, because how are they to know if they are straight? You were not allowed in the lesbian section, as you are a man, and didn't pass as a lesbian woman. It was easier to tell with you that you didn't belong there. The reason why? Probably something to do with the fact that you and your girlfriend thought it would be really funny to go into a gay pub in the first place, and gatecrash the lesbian area. I wouldn't want you there either. It would be like a bunch of non-alcoholics thinking it would be alright to gatecrash an AA meeting. It is not discrimination that they would kick you out of the AA meeting if they knew you weren't an alcoholic, you just didn't fit the 1 criteria to be there. 

It's not discrimination to remove a man from a woman's bathroom. However, it would be if in the entire building, they refused to have male bathroom out of gender discrimination.",t3_z5x6zz
iy5jiw0,t1_iy39yqy,"Ebony, your analogies are flawed.  An AA meeting is not the same as a bar selling to the public.  The fish bowl is not a private club, but part of the *public* bar at that Pub.  The other bars, gay mens “spaces” do not ban women even though they are clearly not gay men.  And often there are more women than men in these spaces.  It became “the thing” for straight women to hang out at gay bars, which is why my gf decided we had to go there (she'd been many times before and knew what she was doing).  

Would you be ok if the gay guys banned women from those bars?  

And you ignore the main point.  Force of law supposedly bans bars and pubs (ones that aren't private clubs and serve the general public) but that *only* prevents discrimination against women apparently.",t3_z5x6zz
iy5pscr,t1_iy5jiw0,"Yes.  I would be okay if an event for gay men did not allow women.  I would be fine with that.  The reason why they likely don't is that women are more likely to be allies of LGBT than men, and are often invited to these places by gay men to avoid straight guys at regular clubs.  However, if gay men did not want them in these spaces, then I would support them not allowing them entry.  Why?  Because the event, club, pub or bar has a set audience and is upholding that.

In the same way that AA meetings are for past or present alcoholics, or the people supporting them.  The same way that maternity centres and gynaecology  centres are for females, and would turn away a man with an illness that has walked in.  The same way that an all boys school, or all girls school, can turn away pupils of the opposite sex. The same way that you were removed from an event for lesbians.

That is different from that AA meeting not allowing someone of a certain sexuality to attend, and it being completely legal to do so.  It is different from a maternity centre not allowing a black women to receive treatment based on her race, and it being legal to do so.  It is different from all schools being able to turn away boys based on their gender and it being legal to do so.  It is different from lesbian events stopping fat women from attending based on their weight, and it being legal to do so.

You see what I am getting at here?  Pubs were not men only as women were allowed in when accompanied by a man.  They were allowed to drink the alcohol the pub provided.  They could just be turned down service based on their gender, and it was legal to do so.  That is gender discrimination, just admit it.",t3_z5x6zz

They just banned men certain days of the week.  Would you be comfortable if your local pub had a “men's day” every Thursday where women were barred?  

And I'll reiterate, this stuff is banned for men according to such laws as you speak of.  I'll say again.  In the 1970's women were barred from the public bar, but would be served in the lounge or Saloon bar.  Are you ok with that?  The public bar being a men only space?",t3_z5x6zz

""However, if gay men did not want them in these spaces, then I would support them not allowing them entry. Why? Because the event, club, pub or bar has a set audience and is upholding that.""  Event or permanent fixture, if a venue was for gay men only, then yes I would be fine with that.  I am okay with a gay venue hosting ""lesbian nights"" or ""gay men nights"", and straight people, or people of the opposite gender to the nights intended audience being barred.   


That is different from what we are talking about here, and I have already said how.  


Women would not be ""served in the lounge"".  The whole point was that it was legal for a woman to be refused service from a bar based on the fact that they are a woman.  That is every bar in every pub, throughout the UK.  We are not talking about working men's clubs, or the odd pub here or there.  It was legal for every single one to discriminate against women if they wanted.  Women could sit in the pub.  They just had to wait for their male company to actually go and buy them their drink.  That is sexism.    


Like I said, there is nothing wrong with boys being turned down from an all girls school.  It's a school for girls, of course he would be.  Same way that you were told to leave a lesbian section of a gay venue since you are a presumably straight man.  However, if tomorrow a law was passed where it was now legal for every school in the country to discriminate against boys and deny him an education based on his gender, then that is wrong.  Even if they allow the boys to walk in the corridors, or sit in the playground.  This is the exact same logic.  If you think it was okay for women to be legally refused service based on their gender, then you surely think it would be okay if every boy could be legally refused an education based on his gender, if schools were suddenly considered ""a girl's space"".",t3_z5x6zz
iy8hl25,t1_iy65n31,"I'm starting to tire of this ebony as you're deliberately playing dumb.  

The Court is NOT a nightclub or private gay club.  It's just a pub which became something of a gay hangout and then oriented itself to that demographic, having drag shows etc.  And as many gay guys here have complained about, it then becomes the height of “chic” for a certain type of straight woman.  To the point that there are often more straight women than gay men there, and plenty of these women's boyfriends they take there!

But these women are never banned.  Yet they are clearly not gay men!

And how about non-gay men?  Would you support bars having a men only night once a week, and no women's only night?

As for the law itself.  You seem to have things a bit skewed on this, which is common for feminists.  The law forbade ALL pubs from denying service to women.  This is *not the same* as all pubs denying service to women prior to that.  The point about the law is that each venue was able to do that if it so wished. The law was to compel them all to not do that.

So again, how do you square this with the Fish Bowl?",t3_z5x6zz
iyavwt5,t1_iy8hl25,"Oh my god, I don't care what type of venue this was. The venue does not matter.  It was labelled for lesbians, which is why you were removed.   


I have already said that I don't disagree with gay men not allowing women in their spaces.  I think they should if they want to.    


I think men only nights would be a good idea.  Men need more spaces to talk openly with other men.    


It should not have been legal for pubs to discriminate service dependant on gender.  We are not talking about gay bars, or ladies nights, or working men clubs.  We are talking about every single pub in the UK having the right to discriminate against women.  Just because some didn't, doesn't mean that it was okay that others could legally.    


If is was legal for you to be denied service from every single bar in the country based on your gender, because bars are now considered a woman's space, do you think that is fair?  Do you think it's fair if it is legal to discriminate against you based on gender, even if some choose not to?

After reading the first paragraph:  They're not going to mention a single damn thing about how men supposedly benefit from divorce, are they?  They're just going to complain about it, or only have data points relating to women, and few/none relating to men, relating to or resulting from divorce, aren't they?

__________________

After reading the article:  Yup, they spend the first half appealing to emotion, and do next to nothing to illustrate how men benefit.  At least one of the NCBI data points they reference has a data set between 1984 and 2015, so it's reliability for *today* is questionable when plenty of that data is almost 40 years old.  Another presumed source/link for information is self-referencing of another Ms Magazine article, showing incredible bias.

Pretty annoying when she suggests a ""declaration of roles and responsibilities"", which sounds an awful lot like a prenup - and dressing it up like she thought of it first.

Also kind of ignorant that her argument for ""more marriage equity"" would actively dismantle plenty of things Feminism fought for; more fair custody, perhaps abolishing alimony, dropping child support through the floor due to both parents having equal custody time, a bunch of other things - with some of these things being more ""fair"" towards men/uplifting husbands & father's.  

But we all know that's not what she meant; she wants the same ""equity"" as a husband that gets divorced improving his life some 5+ years later; she still wants a piece of that pie, but can't connect the dots that if that's what she wants, she has no legal right or claim to it if she's going to divorce that husband.",t3_z62526

They get the kids 80% of the time but then complain about having no free time because they get the kids. But let a man even suggest that they split time 50/50. Then he's a deadbeat that doesn't want to pay child support.

They leave a situation where one party is baring the largest part of the financial burden and then complain when they have to do it all themselves. Even getting half of everything isn't enough.

It never sites how exactly men benefit more than women other than to say that once they take our kids away from us we have more time to focus on work or a social life. But once again trying to suggest 50/50 is off the table. It doesn't take into account the fact that the man now has to support two households instead of one if he expects to see his children. Or that if he seems happier it might be simply because he no longer has to take on the ""emotional labor"" of putting up with her nonsense. However, it doesn't speak of the emotional, financial, and sometimes physical toll of losing his family and becoming a part time influence on his kids all while still juggling a job or career and supporting two households takes on him.

Many of these men want custody of their kids and want to take care of their children. If there's anything good to take away from this article it's that smart judges should stop awarding custody to the mothers so blindly during divorce cases. Let some mothers pay child support while the children are raised by the parent who wants them around.

And then she goes on to wanting to reduce a romantic emotional intimate relationship to a business contract. If she wants to do that she can.

The truth is that no fault divorce was so women could opt out of marriage more easily, and get remarried. Divorce isn't the end of an unhappy marriage (thats legal separation) but actually a licence to marry someone else.  And let's face it, is the marriage really over if you retain financial obligations to them?

Of course, ""criminal"" is quite vague, that's why we also have the terms thief, pickpocket, burglar, murderer, etc. But we also convey meaning by assembling words. For example we have ""bank robber"" that doesn't have a specific single word for it, so we could have ""misogyn murderer"", ""misogyn assaulter"" etc.

Now it is a somewhat minor ""absurdity"" to suggest that an idiot like Tate hates women (i.e. misogyny) on the same level as say the Boston Strangler (who targeted only females in a multi-year murdering spree). However, even though there are far worse absurdities people have been manipulated into believing, I still choose to just categorize Tate as a ""chauvinist"", since I think it's relatively safe to ignore his nonsense for the most part and focus our efforts instead on identifying and protecting ourselves from truly dangerous predators in society. Another benefit of this ""prioritization"" approach is that having various efficient words – with ""chauvinist"" to ""sexist"" to ""misogynist"" outlining increasingly rare, distinct levels of growing societal disapproval and sanction – available to differentiate people, objects, ideas, etc, allows us to actually *make sense* of the world around us, which cannot be overlooked as a basic foundation for our mental health, especially when we are trying to make our way though such a large and complex system as our modern world (to understand more about this concept, I highly recommend listening to [Daniel Schmachtenberger's thoughts](https://youtu.be/7LqaotiGWjQ) regarding what he has termed ""The War on Sensemaking"").",t3_z626ts

In my opinion a man cheating is even worse. Sex is a much bigger deal for men, because they do not have any birth control, natural planning method or abortion. So if he's having sex with another woman, he does not have any reliable way to prevent pregnancy (condoms are only about 80% reliable).

Then sorry but your opinion is just plain wrong, based on most of out human history. Her having ability to have a baby is just that much of a big deal, men do not have the same consequences. If she could not get the guy or slept with multiple men and did not know who was the father...she was fuked and would stay as single mother, and most likely would be viewed as hoe. That's why for women and for society, woman fuking around mattered much more...plus, in the end, they are the ones who have control over sex, if she just says no man can't do anything so even more responsibility falls on her.

This is not true. In inuit cultures women were allowed to sleep with the husbands house guests as a welcome gesture. In himba culture of Namibia women are encouraged to sleep with tourists, even married women. But the husband's are not. In old English culture, a wife was expected to sleep with the lord/king the night before her marriage. There are plenty of examples of cultures where women had more sexual freedom than men. The only people who disagree with this are feminists with a victim complex. 

But anyways, the past is irrelevant. In our current situation, women can sleep around with much less consequences than men. (Birth control, plan b, abortion etc)  this sub has agreed with this stance on multiple different occasions. 

""plus, in the end, they are the ones who have control over sex, if she just says no man can't do anything""

Both genders control access to sex. Men can also say no and the woman can't do anything. 

""And that was the trend almost everywhere throughout history since ancient times.""

This was the reality not some bs progressives push for whatever reason.

3. Then you agree with me lol. Women can sleep around with much less consequences than men thanks to birth control and abortion. Therefore, a man sleeping around or cheating on his wife is OBJECTIVELY worse than a woman doing the same thing. You can't even argue with this it's just a fact

4. It doesn't matter who wants it more. You're not a wild animal, you can control yourself. You can say no to sex it's not that hard

To me it is pretty simple.  If you are in an established relationship there is an inherent expectation of sexual behaviour. However, that behaviour comes with a level of respect and honesty that means that sexual encounters just don't happen, the evolve from some form of intimacy and foreplay.

There is an expectation that a rape is a sexual encounter that has some form of violence or sexual act *after* the other party has said no. If either party is not fully alert, then there is a definite lack of respect if something happens.

In this case she says she blacked out but was awake while her BF had sex with her.  Whether she said No, thought she said no, whether they was any foreplay or not, we just don't know. However, there are a few ""checkpoints"" along the way. Was she naked? Did he undress her? Did she undress her? etc etc. A chat in the morning saying ""hey, I didn't appreciate that"" is the minimum to get started IMO.

My opinion on ""accidental rape"" is there is no such thing. Rape is when one party (male or female) forces themselves on the other party (male or female) with force *after* the other party makes it clear they are not interested in having sex at that time.

What we have here is an *unwanted sex act.* In a healthy relationship, if you think it's in appropriate tell them, if they do it again, it's rape or sexual assault.",t3_z63qfr

In American society, we focus on the business owners and the guys who are blatantly “important.” Construction workers, the dudes who fix the power lines, and police are just as important.

The issue with a lot of men's rights posts is that they assume this world is just and fair. It's not, and there will always be double standards (some for good reason).

When they are arrested, they are less likely to be convicted of a crime, but if someone dies, I would hope that this difference is small.

When they are convicted, they get lighter sentences in a court of law than men, for the same offenses, by wide margin. 

At every step, some offenses are filtered out, but again, since someone died, the big difference maker is that last one: lighter sentences. As it applies here, murder charges can be lowered to manslaughter or self defense. While I could be mistaken, I would assume that manslaughter and self defense aren't considered in murder statistics, otherwise it would be considering deaths from car accidents and things like that as well.

Dead people do get reported regardless of how they died.

Prison is one way of excluding from society but it's not the only way.

You beat somebody up? Yeah, we should not be friends with someone like that. We shouldn't be in relationships/marriages with someone like that……violent behavior should result in being shut out from society.
Obviously, that shouldn't be permanent, at least not on „ground level“, but the use of violence needs to hurt first and foremost the perpetrators.

I tried searching for data on regular manslaughter perpetrators by gender, and after 10 minutes of searching I couldn't find it. Let me know if you can find those stats, but that'll tell you if there's anything to be had here. That's where the underreporting would be evident. And if it's not there, then I'm wrong.

Underreporting in this case occurs when the reported rate is less than the actual rate of something, whatever the cause. 

It's specifically a problem in cases of domestic abuse and rape/sexual assault because the definitions used to create these buckets are highly gendered. Many models that the police use for domestic abuse, most prevalently the Duluth model, *assumes* that the woman is the victim and the man is the perpetrator, regardless of who called the police or who has injuries. As a result, men learn not to call the cops and not to report their abuse. Men also learn socially never to be victims, so it's not any more likely to be reported outside of police action. Like I said earlier with rape as well: many, many places use the gendered definition of rape or sexual assault that prevents women from being a perpetrator in the language, and again, socially men are trained to never be victims, so they aren't going to report their rapes or sexual assaults.

Almost 80% of homicide victims were men, and yet in these conversations it still feels like we're focusing entirely on woman victims.

Are you sure about that? I'm pretty sure we have a thing called prison. And mandatory minimum sentences, they exist right?

 

>You or anyone else is not allowed to use violence against anyone.

Self defence? Im pretty sure that's legal and can be violent. Being in an active war zone? Technically legal, very violent.

I don't know where you are trying to take this conversation, I've already agreed with you multiple times, I just don't believe the way to solve violent crime specifically is to force (let's be honest) your opinions of violence on to others.

I could possibly agree with the view that people commit crimes because of issues that they face. 

I don't think that was the initial view though. It was a case of ‘men commit these crimes, men are bad'.

It's also worth pointing out that I don't think this Critical Race Theory blames black people in the same way that men are blamed. It's framed positively from the outset, they commit crimes because of issues that they face, whereas for men it's automatically ‘men bad'.",t3_z680dp
iy7ed5s,t1_iy7c53a,"In terms of female victims of murder, in this discussion (on the men's rights sub) obviously there's no issue in that particular area. More generally though, violence against men and indeed the lives of men are consistently valued less than women, and speaking up about that is opposed by many people advocating women's rights, as if rights as a movement are a zero sum game. 

That I can absolutely speak to, and I'll give two examples.

For valuing life, look at any reporting of war or combat. They will talk about some amount of women and children, and then later and de-emphasized, mention the total, several times higher. You might say that combat zones doesn't apply to most people in the US though, so let's move past that. You could also look at workplace deaths, the proportion of genders in the most dangerous jobs, life expectancy vs retirement age, the draft, homeless population, and countless other examples. To most people, a man's life means less that a woman's life.

For being able to speak up, it's a topic of pretty regular discussion among women I hang out with how any guy they meet could be waiting to murder them, and yet as a man I'm 3.5x more likely to be murdered. Apples to apples, men have it worse there. If I bring up the same points, or highlight that fact when that topic of discussion gets brought up, without exception I get shamed for it. How dare I highlight that fact. If I even imply that men can worry about the same things, I get told that it's different/worse for women, or that it's not as bad/not an issue for men, as if men aren't allowed to be afraid. That's one place where the discussion gets shut down.

For your female friends:

So they discuss that they are afraid in certain situations because there are men that murder women in this situations and your answer is „men have it worse because they get murdered more often“. 
By your own logic, is that not discounting female victims? Are you not invalidating your friends fears by that?
And on another note, don't you see the common denominator? The vast majority of murderers are violent men, no matter if the victim is male or female. So don't you see that there needs to be done something about those violent men and about violence in general?",t3_z680dp

I'm not saying anything in response to a woman saying it, that's whataboutism and downplaying for sure, I'm saying that *I can't talk about this shit and get support, and I can even be mocked by my friends in a public setting for it.*

You took my statement about men's lives not mattering and started talking about something completely different, as if to avoid saying that men's lives matter as much as anyone else's.

You took my statement about violence against men being downplayed in favor of talking about violence against women and... Downplayed it in favor of talking about violence against women.

This has convinced me even more that nobody will ever care or value my life at even a tenth that of a woman's. Nobody cares if I get raped: I get laughed at or told to move on. Nobody cares about my mental health: I'm a liability. I could be violent. Nobody will even give me the airspace to advocate for the same rights and privileges that other people enjoy: I'm already privileged and I'm just asking for more.

People on this sub have bad takes, but every time I think I'm going to leave, I'm reminded that truly, deep down, society doesn't give a single shit about me, except how I can grind myself down to benefit others. I don't have intrinsic value, I'm just 'in the way'.",t3_z680dp

So let me get that straight, you tried to proof how women murder more then statistics say. You failed with that. Then you tried to say that this discussion focuses to much on female victims, even though we
never discussed female victims here and now you try to shame me, for not discussing any and all problems men have, in this thread.

Whatever man.",t3_z680dp
iybkd51,t1_iy9l06i,"I tried to respond to each thing you brought up, if you care, but here's what I'm trying to get across in a nutshell.

I'm not the original commenter, so I'll just abandon his points. All I want, me personally, is to be empathized with, and for people to admit that some struggles are uniquely gendered male, and it feels really really hard to hear that... Well anywhere. I want you to try to see things from my point of view before you disagree with me, and see that I go through pain. And then see the secondary pain that comes from nobody giving a shit about that first pain, and having just about nowhere healthy to go deal with the whole like I'm left with.

You're probably in here thinking we're all cretins, and think we're just here to start shit and muddy the waters, and I get that, but I earnestly tell you, I'm not. I'm not here to pity party myself, I'm here because I went through stuff that sucked, and I saw other people get help based on their gender that was inaccessible to me.

If you, totally separate from this discussion (since it's becoming a rats nest in many ways) want to interrogate any view I hold or express, I'm happy to explain my point of view or change my view if I can't explain it.

After this though, I'm signing off of this thread

Re: discussion

Yeah, that wasn't clear on my end. If we are sitting down and having a discussion, then I'll bring it up. If it comes up organically as an issue or a concern, that's definitely not appropriate to turn it into something about me/the things I advocate for. Clarification was needed there.

If my friends are discussing their fears then I discuss mine too, and if they say I don't need to worry then I did bring out stats once, yes.

Re: murder stats

The guy above me made an assertion and I (like a naive idiot, I might add) tried to find basis for it. That basis eventually led nowhere, so therefore the premise is wrong: original claim is therefore junk, and I agree now. OP was probably drawing from the real phenomenon that women receive lighter sentences, but that doesn't really connect to murder rates from what's visible here.

Re: discussion focus

I tried to say that discussions about violence and murder *in general* tend to focus on female victims, which is true in media and in social settings. This specific discussion is one of the few places on Reddit where that isn't the case, so I'm not referring to that.

Do men just not have hobbies to make them happy?

it depends on how much self-awareness they have, and from the definition that you can conceive of the word ""happiness"".

-going to the cinema ( recent blockbusters+ cult classics/old movies in small town cinemas).
Last time I went to the cinema with someone else was over 15 years ago ( with my kids).

-collecting music CDs/cassettes/vinyls ( about 4000 ish). Going to music fairs.

-going to rock concerts/festivals. ( 200+ so far and counting) 

-going to the opera/ballet/theatre. Most recent was Vienna opera and a ballet in Paris. I also love going to small theatres and encouraging local theatre troupes. 

-books (reading/collecting mens pulp adventure novels/going to book fairs etc). I've got 4-5000 books in two rooms now.  I read 1-2 books a week. 

-cars ( collecting cars/going to Le Mans/Spa/Formula 1/ GT races around Europe). 

-adopting cats ( currently have 6) and temporarily babysitting abandoned/abused cats until they can find another owner.

-sport ( lifting weights/cycling).

-visiting historical places.

- spending time in art galleries/museums. 

- hiking/wild camping.  I like to go off by myself whenever possible and hike across the countryside or travel further afield and hike along the coast or in the mountains. 

-traveling ( over 40 countries visited). I don't like staying in luxury hotels. I prefer to stay in unusual places/off the beaten track ( tree house/converted light house etc). 

-volunteering at a women's refuge for victims of trafficking/domestic violence/immigrants and refugees. 

-collecting 1980's memorabilia.

I live a full enriching life. I'm perfectly happy doing all the above things by myself or with some friends.

Women here in Southern Europe want men with masculine hobbies like making/building things, doing team sports. 
winter sports, sailing etc. I don't do any of those so I now keep my hobbies to myself. I do these on my own so again it comes across to women here that I'm solitary/boring etc. Women have often criticized me  for not having more ‘masculine' hobbies which is quite ridiculous. 

One of my friends is a successful children's author and women get turned off when he tells them that he collects antique children's toys, he collects old fairground rides and he also collects historical kitchen utensils/equipment. Women think he's weird and even too feminine ( he's a 6'6 amateur wrestler).

I've no idea why people think some hobbies are masculine and some feminine. IMO you do what makes you happy.

​**A page from Red Pill Psychology (Must read book on this topic):**

The psychology of hate

Years back, in another life, I presented at seminars and conferences that provided continuing education units for professional re-certification. In one particular module, I used a portable grease board in a room in front of my waiting audience. Without introducing myself or saying anything else, I used a grease pen to write the words ""Men are..."" at the top of the board, and then silently invited the audience to finish the sentence.

Almost invariably, ""pigs"" or ""dogs"" was the first offering, accompanied by a room full of good-natured chuckles. I would nod my head and write it down on the board and return to the audience, still silent, for more.

""Controlling,"" says one. ""Afraid of commitment,"" says another. ""Aggressive."" ""Macho"" ""Afraid of intimacy."" ""Violent."" ""Sexist,"" and ""Power hungry."" More of the pejoratives, and almost only pejoratives, would come from the audience till the board was full.

I then flipped the board to the other side. ""Women are..."" was the cue, and the answers were even more rapid fire than they were with men. ""Strong."" ""Capable"" ""Empowered"" ""Sensitive."" ""Nurturing,"" and the like would fly from the audience to the grease board like a barrage of arrows, till that side too was full.

""What do you imagine,"" I would ask, taking a strategic pause for a sip of water, ""that these answers tell us about the real nature of sexism in the way we view men and women?""

Asking them a question with actual spoken words must of thrown them for a loop, because the stock response to that question was almost invariably a room full of nonplussed, cognitively dissonant faces. And that confusion usually gave way to irritation, clearly at me, though every answer on both sides of that board had come from them. And by the way, the participants in the crowd? They weren't accountants or nurses or teachers or financial advisors.

They were mental health professionals.

They were counselors, psychotherapists, social workers and the like; the very people we love to imagine possess the objectivity to rise above the mindset of bigotry and sexism. And the people, despite our want of faith in their work, least likely to actually do it.

I wanted a little more pressure so I asked more questions. ""How could this affect our therapeutic alliance with clients?- Could it make our relationships with females enabling?- Punitive with men?"" And always, the final question I asked was ""Do we carry sexism, against men, unconscious or conscious, into our work with each and every client?"" With that question the anger usually intensified.

In one talk, a female participant, a social worker, jumped out of her chair and threw her papers everywhere. ""You're the sexist!"" she hissed at me, and stormed out of the room. She later wrote letters of complaint both about my topic and the fact I would not sign off on her attendance.",t3_z686gg

This [happened recently](https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/26/us/chesapeake-virginia-walmart-shooting-saturday/index.html) and is something I wanna bring up real quick.

Idk if you did, apologies if so, but as an employee of walmart (not that one) I still think it's something to be brought up. (Also because I just have insight to how walmart works)

So a manager went in and shot up I think it was 6 employees? And then himself. Why?

Wrll, mental illness/bullying. He thought the government was watching him qnd showed weird behavior (which we have quarterly training on that says ""if you see odd behavior mentiom it to management or walmart ethics"", but again I doubt anyone thought otherwise, trust me I wouldn't) (the weird behavior being taping his phone camera, and possibly other things) 

The coworkers (we say associates) would make fun of him and 'give him evil grins', I think call him nicknames, etc. I've actually dealt with this with 2 past teams. They would ostracized me and make me work alone, and would call me useless and make fun of me. (I'm okay, and in another department that appreciates me actually.)

But the fact that this is even COMMON is sickening. And no one ever helps. If one call was made to help from ethics (whom I've heard actually cracks down on shite) maybe this wouldn't have happened. 

Mayne if therapy was accessible/acceptable to men maybe this wouldn't have happened. 

I maybe a woman, but I do have men in my life. And its sickening knowing how therapy is for them. I've been to a few, and have helped me, but I didnt understand why my fiance might have been nervous yo try. And this thread (and subreddit) helps a lot. 

Men dont create mass shootings. Mental illness, bullying, and suicidality does. 

Why the fuck can't we be nice to people? Why the fuck can't someone see someone suffering and help? I get it, its terrifying to see someone have a mental illness. I have multiple, and I get terrifying. But we still need help.

2) There's a massive malnourishment issue since the 1960's because we demonize saturated fat, which is crucial for brain development and general health. Kids in general are growing up underdeveloped. Combined with #1 that's a recipe for disaster with boys. 

3) Environmental poisons are causing high estrogen in men and hormone imbalances in general, which can lead to emotional problems.

This is my theory: Naturally 80% of men are incels, women go only for the top 20%, so shooters are just a natural reaction to that. Just an ultra-violent reaction to eternal loneliness that is men's lives.

The church had a great idea 2000 years ago: Marry one men to one women, so loneliness vanish. It was brilliant, no more violence, men were busy raising kids and working.

If we assume that behavior is distributed across a population somewhat evenly, the number of mass shooters should be committed roughly 1:1 with representation in the general population. In this example, white men commit somewhere around 50% of all mass shootings, while whites are 65% of the population. This means whites are \*underrepresented\* if we're comparing via race. 

Of course multivariate analysis is preferable, so if we drill down by race and sex we do see that only 30% of the population is white and male, so white men are disproportionately represented \*among whites\* by about 20%. Black males are roughly 6% of the US population but commit 20% of all shootings. If this pattern were to hold across all racial groups white men would need to have committed 100% of all mass shootings, which just shows you how much the problem varies by race and sex. 

Men, of course, commit essentially all mass killings (be they via gun or other methods) but that's also kind of redundant. Men are fueled by testosterone, which makes us capable of extreme violence in ways women simply cannot fathom.

I can imagine that being in your situation sucks, but i can not *truly* understand what you are going through. No one but you can do that. 

But something that i do understand is the feeling of being frustrated by things that are out of my control. This is where i want to lay the focus of my message to you. 

I have been frustrated about things that are beyond my control for the biggest part of my life. At first it was just a few, in my mind, major things that were beyond my control. The things is just that, the more energy i put into trying to get a grip on these things, the more things seemingly piled up that, suddenly, were beyond my control too! 

The more i fought, the more ground i lost. More and more things became beyond my control until i came to a point were i realized that there really is only one single thing within my control. *The only thing that we truly have power over is how we choose to view things.* Our perspective of things is what makes us who we are.

One very important thing for me is Hanlon's razor. Hanlon's razor is the idea that you should not attribute malice to something that can be explained by stupidity. Things that hurt us or piss us off are reflections of our own insecurities. When someone says something that hurts you, you'll probably think that this person wanted to hurt you. But, more often then not these people don't even understand that what they are doing is hurtful or how hurtful something actually is. I don't want to believe that the average person is hateful, i can, and very much do believe that the average person is stupid and ignorant. 

And this brings me back to you, when you say:

>I will never forgive the black community. They have shown me, ever since I was a teen, that they are incredibly two-faced. If you don't fit into their perception of what a black man ""should be"", you are cast out and shunned for all to see. Such humiliation has caused me to hate the very race that I believe would love me no matter what.

Do you really want to think and believe that these people did this because they were part of the black community? Or do you want to believe that these people did this because they're a bunch of stupid ignorant people who had no idea what they were doing to you? Do you believe that these people really wanted to hurt you as much as possible and because they are black? Or would it be more apt to say that they did what they did because of their own insecurities regardless of their skin colour?

Personally i would view such a situation as a group of people that are completely ignorant of the struggles that you went through. While some people are emotionally stunted for life, most people do not want to actually hurt anyone. Only absolute psychopaths relish the idea of actually hurting someone for shits and giggles, and i like to believe that humanity isn't just a bunch of psychopaths. 

This state of mind isn't to benefit them, it isn't to excuse their behaviour. It shows that you are the one that understands their petty behaviour and that they can't touch you with their own insecurities. Be above their pettiness and show them that you don't really care what someone who holds the opinion's that they do has to say.

2. If the court does not find them to be guilty then they aren't guilty. Simple. Feminists literally see a man being found not guilty due to lack of evidence as equivalent to him getting away with it. Believe it or not - despite what you want to believe - women can't just be taken by their word and just because a woman says something is true doesn't mean it is.

Indeed this is hilarious. Men were found not guilty in a court of law (usually due to lack of evidence or it being proven the woman was lying), and you are somehow taking the fact that these men weren't chucked in jail at simply a woman's word as proof that women are oppressed and the failure of the justice system. To you women not being able to just ruin a man's life based on an unbacked claim is equivalent to oppression. Just think about that for a minute... 

You know women are privileged and feminists are all supremacists when the only grievance they have is that they can't treat men the same as whites treated blacks in 19th century America. Cos that is effectively what you're saying - that a woman wasn't blindly believed and the men actually got a fair trial is oppression of women. To you a ""fair system"" is one in which men are just chucked in jail based on a woman's word. Remind me how you're the good guys and not modern day Nazis again?

I do appreciate the feminists who post on here though. Sometimes I wonder ""hmm perhaps I'm wrong and they do have some good arguments"". And then every post I see from you lot is either 1. literal supremacist rhetoric, 2. uses cherry picked or non existent evidence, 3. filled with double standards and hypocrisy, 4.　all of the above.

Trump's constant repeating of things like “Crooked Hillary,” according to Lakoff, was strengthening a particular frame, subconsciously causing us to view her in that way.  
Because of concerns like these, Lakoff urged the Clinton campaign to follow a strategy akin to Trump's: constantly repeat your position, and avoid repeating Trump's false claims. The Clinton campaign's response? It tried to use Trump's words against him, releasing a series of commercials showing Trump's scandals spliced together – giving the public more chances to “think of an elephant.”

Whatever else one wants to say about feminists, they've also been very successful at getting the public to think of elephants, by flooding the airwaves and cyberspace with terms like buzzwords like ""toxic masculinity"", ""The Patriarchy"", and ""White CIS Patriarchal Hegemony"". We here at The MRM have far too often emulated Hilary Clinton's campaign, by trying to take the piss out of these buzzwords/show how much smarter we are then the opposition, rather than constantly repeating our message(""Men are just as vital to the functioning of our civilization as women are. Denying us access to our children in the event of a divorce, and paths to upward mobility is harmful to everyone"") and regularly emphasizing to the folks back home in Tacoma and Tampa all the ways in which supporting our cause will relieve their day to day burdens.

iy3ftya,t3_z6pu4c,"About rape and consent. Ignore what everybody says, this is a cultural issue. Rape, as a concept and as something frowned upon exists only because something of value is considered to be taken by force. Woman's sexuality is of value to society, and her private property, so there is a process called consent by which she trades it with another person. 

Male sexuality, on the other hand, has no value. Maybe because there is a lot more offer than demand. Maybe because we have the cheaper sexual cells. Who knows. But that means that consent, the contract by which we allow people to take our sexuality is not really existant in the societal level, we abstract it from the one women have, but it doesn't work because, in the end, our culture has placed no value in our sexuality, therefore it isn't very capable of understanding the need of  us to allow or prohibit anybody from using our sexuality. In that case, rape, as it occurs in many first world countries, only exists legally if it happens to women. And, at the same time, we make jokes about men being raped. Because nothing of value was lost, at least for our culture. 

Does this mean than male sexuality has no inherent value and consent shouldn't be taken into consideration? No. But we cannot confuse what is with what should be. And, what is, is that we are in a culture that treats men as disposable objects, and the only value we have is the value of the objects we add to us. Nothing that is a part of our human constitution is of value inherently in this society. Not our sexuality, not our lives. If a bomb falls and kills a hundred men and a woman there will be a parade for the women and a note for us. If a war explodes and only men fight the press will talk about how this has destroyed women's life. Every time that there is a choice between your life and a woman's yours will be last. This is what we are. And that is the reason why Men's Rights Activism is necessary.

\- Fully sealed package, so he'd never suspect the condom was tampered with

\- Also sold pregnancy tests that showed positive for pregnancy 100% of the time with the headline ""He's not ready to commit? Force the issue!"" 

Wow. So basically fraud. Using blackmail to force men into marriages. Thing is the article I was reading at the time detailed how large numbers of men were contacting Craigslist to take down these ads, but they refused. Craigslist cracks down on all sorts of ads that it deems violating its terms of services, but sabotaging mens protection from unwanted pregnancy to turn them into financial slaves for 18 or more years? NO PROBLEM! GREEN-LIGHT, post freely!

https://thewalrus.ca/is-it-illegal-to-lie-about-using-contraception/

This shows that it's something they are in the process of figuring out though.

Essentially the main difference seems to be that women can be harmed by getting pregnant - physically it puts your life at risk, and sex without a condom is an increased risk of STD's - and the same is not true for not taking the pill for a man.

There is a strong feminist argument though that it isn't about the pregnancy, but the inherent loss of dignity and autonomy, which would certainly apply to men as well in terms of qualifying as rape.

This then becomes a conundrum and that is likely the reason why it is not currently getting the attention it deserves - outside of a forced abortion which is a crime in itself, what is the remedy?

The state cannot advocate against requiring maximum support for a child, even to the detriment of both parents, because that is unfair to the kid. Financial support is structured to incentivize parents to provide a stable home environment - either you pay for the kid or you play with the kid, or you are doing both, essentially.

So giving dads a loophole to avoid child support is a bad idea. I suppose that theoretically it would at least make sense for dad's in this situation to sue the mother after the kid has become emancipated for the child support they paid - I would absolutely advocate for something like that and it would also reasonably include interest as well.

But that's about the only thing I can think of. Because prosecuting a woman for rape for lying about not taking her BC is going to be incredibly difficult unless you have it clearly stated in text, with with witnesses, etc. And it might open up men to being counter-accused of stealthing as a defense, which I think would be easier to ""prove"" in the event that what triggers the case is a pregnancy. The whole situation is very he said-she said. That doesn't make it worth criminalizing, but it does make criminalizing effectively incredibly difficult and potentially causing more harm than good.

YES, intercourse without a condom is really that good that so many men risk such outcomes. However and luckily, intercourse with a condom is still amazing and wonderous...

To not engage with sex purely for the physical, but to regard it as a sacred thing, that yes incorporates the physical and animalistic, but also the divine and the sweet...

When we take our woman in the ways of old, when we make love to not only her body but her very soul....

Well then we as men come to enjoy our single greatest reward for being true, for being protectors, for being MEN.

Tell this genuine virgin-incel, to not overly worry about women, until he has first remembered his purpose and given himself up to this sacred charge as his highest priority, higher even than his love and lust for his woman....

For the REST of you who might be interested in how social change works, keep reading.

If you start at no-fault divorce (1970 or so) and  go to the point where Lyndon B.  Johnson's welfare state starts kicking in,  we're at 1975.  This is also when [Title IV-D begins the demonic conflict of interest between the family and government.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1HadqGVyxI&t=5s) This is also where the welfare state begins to destroy the family unit.

For some reason, African American's are the  canaries in the American coal mine of social change. Why is this important Back in the late 1800's when political scientists started keeping track, this group had the highest intact family rate among ALL groups in the USA at >85%.   But ADC, Title IV-D and other ""Great Society"" bullshit reversed this--in the name of votes.  Less than 40 years later, that number has reversed.  >85% broken homes.

10 years later? [Reagan's enhancement of Title IV-D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqHvLYh4MEs)

10 years later? Clinton's weaponization of Title IV-D via  what he called the [""Deadbeat Dad""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cf0X-1mWzl0)bill.  It was NEVER about the kids.  It was ALWAYS about money.

So effectively, the damage has been done in roughly 20-25 years.  This is hardly the centuries and eons that OP suggests.  When you consider what the American family looked like (and for how long), 20 years ain't shit. Fuck, that was faster blitz than the Schwarzkopf on the Republican Guard or Napoleon on the Prussians. Imagine wrecking a centuries-old (if not eons-old) institution in the span of 20-25 short years.   So that tells us that it can be done.  Because it WAS done.  Without social media or anything that could go viral.

So if there was:

**Scandinavian-style child suppor**t (Max -400 child support for temporary time period, if awarded at all

**Default 50-50 custody** 

**Mandatory DNA Testing at Birth**

**Financial abortion** (Man can opt out of fatherhood the way a woman can opt out of the responsibilities of motherhood)

**Divorcing/Cheating/Beating spouse forfeits house and all joint money and only takes what they brought into marriage?**

**Title IV-D reform**

Main Plot

Lisa tries to solve a brain teaser, and she fails as Martin, Milhouse, Bart, and even Nelson can solve it. She does not remember the code combination for her school locker, also forgets to do an agriculture project, and does a last minute job of an ""eraser pig"", and loses her saxophone technique. These things point to evidence that Lisa fears she is losing her gift of intelligence. When she tells about this to Grampa, he tells her that all the members of the Simpson family—including himself, Homer, and Bart—started smart at first, but later became dumber, as part of the Simpson Genes. Eventually, Lisa becomes dumb like both Homer and Bart. After a nightmare of being married to Ralph and being unintelligent with children, she rejects her new-found idiocy.

Lisa appears on Smartline and demands that the citizens of Springfield treasure their brains. As she does this, Homer having found out what Abe has done, brings all of the Simpson family relatives to the house in an attempt to prove that the whole family is not a bunch of idiots. When all the Simpsons visit, Homer goes and asks all the men what their jobs are. These include running an unsuccessful shrimp company, shooting birds at the airport, dressing up like a millionaire and going to parties, jumping in front of cars and suing the drivers, begging celebrities for money, prison snitch and jug band manager. Lisa is more depressed and Homer sends all of them away, beginning to feel that the Simpsons are pathetic. 

However as he does so, Marge points out that Homer only talked to the men in his family and asks him to talk to his female relatives. Homer reluctantly does so and he finds one in a white labcoat (and similar in appearance to Lisa) and asks what her career is--Homer reads her nametag as ""Dr. Simpson,"" which perks Lisa up. Dr. Simpson reveals, ""I'm the chief of complicated surgeries at an invasive care clinic."" The rest of the women all reveal their careers as well, such as being an environmental lawyer, an architect and even the lead sales coordinator at a bed company, showing themselves to be very successful. When Lisa questions why the Simpson-gene didn't affect the women on her father's side of the family, Dr. Simpson explains that the defective gene is found only on the Y chromosome, so only the men in the Simpson-family are affected by it. Lisa, having been born a female, is a double-X chromosome and will likely become very successful like the women on her father's side of the family. Lisa regains her confidence in being smart, knowing that the defective Simpson gene won't affect her due to her sex. However, Bart asks Homer that since Lisa and even Maggie are going to be successful if he will be an unintelligent failure like the men since he inherited the defective Simpson gene. He confirms it, making Bart wary and bemoaning his future as a failure. Homer reassures him that he will be a ""spectacular failure."" Bart happily accepts this and returns to playing with the other males with pans over their heads.

Lisa writes in her journal about how she feels like she can accomplish anything, then solves the brain teaser that she couldn't initially solve before (which was simply numbers laterally inverted making the final product ""1 2 3 4 5 6). At which point she exclaims ""woo-hoo!!"" (proving that while the ""Simpson gene"" won't affect her, she's still a Simpson nonetheless), before correcting herself. 

The defective Simpson gene is on the Y-chromosome and thus only affects the male members of the family.

It's just a blatant ignoring of his clear non-consent. He was trying to be polite, instead of saying ""NO!!"", and making her cry. 

I've had women try and 'soften' me up as I'm very stoic and strict about my boundaries; this included spiking my drink so I was so sedated I couldn't walk, and slugging me in the stomach and pushing me over a wall, ""so I could see how much she liked me"".

iy5udic,t3_z6zsj0,"There's something to understand about online spaces in general, but especially those related to relationships.

Women in general do not understand consent the way that they promote it. They understand *their own* boundaries and consent very well, but when it comes to their partners', all of that goes out the window. If you ask 10 women if they've ever asked a man for consent in the way that they expected to be asked for consent, some will say no, and the others will lie that they have. 

As a mid-30s man with dozens of sexual partners, I have not once in my entire life been asked for consent. 

The men who post on relationship-related communities generally are inexperienced and desperate for any sexual contact. For example, the age-old question of oral sex often comes up on them, where women don't have to perform oral sex if they don't want to, but men who don't perform oral sex are terrible partners and people in general. The women will naturally agree with this (again, due to a lack of respect for men's boundaries), and the men will agree because they're projecting themselves into the man's position.

Yes, women constantly say ""***my body, my choice, men are not entitled to sex, blah, blah...***""

Yet when **THEY** want ""*affection*"" they feel entitled to it and play stupid when the man doesn't reciprocate because he has boundaries.

""***He's being weird....he has a warped mindset....he's insecure...etc etc***""

Funny how the rules change when the women want something the man does not.

We slept in the same bed (it was the second time ever we slept so close) and I was feeling very cold when I got into the bed, and asked her to put  my legs inside of her legs to warm up. She agreed and I put my feet between her legs and she is always warmer than me so I got warmer too. Then I hugged her and asked her if she loved  me, she rolled her eyes and said ""of course I love you, you shouldn't even ask"". Then I kissed her and she kissed me back, but she was tired and she closed her eyes saying she wanted to rest. Then I did something I shouldnt have: I started running my hand on her chest (I know I shouldnt say this, but I really think she is perfect, and love everything about her) and she said ""stop it cause you're tickling me"".I stopped but tbj I was in the mood for some cuddles, while she clearly wasnt.At some point I don't know what got me, but I lowered the strap of her white undershirt to uncover her nipple, I thought it was so cute and perfect and put it in my mouth.  At that point she reacted right away, she was very upset and said ""what the hell are you doing? Where the hell did you learn those things?"" you could see it in her eyes that she was very, very ANGRY.She was clearly mad and I felt so stupid for not understanding that she clearly wasn't in the mood that night. I wanted affection and did that impulsive gesture not understanding that it might upset her.It was the first time ever I ever did something so inconsiderate and impulse driven like this.

iy7e6h6,t1_iy4qitp,"Rage or potentially harmful behaviours. Is it just me that balks a little at this? I hear it a lot - usually something to the effect of: ""men process emotions differently, instead of being X, they'll show anger or rage"".

How common is this really?? As a man, I can't relate to it at all (and I've attempted suicide etc. like I'm sure a lot of people have).

Not to saying it doesn't ever happen; that a suicidal impulse can't manifest that way. I've seen really fucked up people - like deeply disturbed people - who show those kind of dangerous behaviours that I think you're referring to - and it seems to be part of the package that drives them to self-harm and possibly do suicidal things. So, I know it can be like that. But I'm thinking of people that very few of us would willingly choose to associate with, like these are fairly extreme outlier-type people.

So as a general rule - the emotions that drive suicide showing up as rage.... I wonder if other guys can relate to that or if it's just me that's like ""what""??",t3_z73j2n
iy6q3to,t1_iy4qitp,"Wait... the OP says:

***""men don't want to confide in another guy. It feels weird, it doesn't feel right or comfortable. You want to confide in a female. They'll care, they'll help.""***

And you got **""*****talk to men*****""** out of it?

I don't think women \*have\* to be terrible at empathy. It is a skill you can learn. Quite frankly, it's not that hard to learn. I know some women who have learned to be very empathetic. And I know some men who have learned to be very empathetic.

But both men and women need to LEARN empathy. It isn't a natural trait that exists because of what type of genitals you have.

I think the OP believes that too. They didn't say anything along the lines of women are just biologically incapable of learning to listen better. They just said women in modern society generally aren't very good at it.

And the real problem is just that nobody calls women out on being bad at empathizing with men.

It would be silly to think I speak for all women, but at the same time, I've seen so many men say that they don't want to/can't talk to their women counterparts due to women fumbling the bag so to speak. In my world, that means that something needs to be done differently. Beating your head against walls in hopes that they crumble hurts the person more than the wall.

iy837kj,t1_iy7t380,"Yeah, fair enough. I mean, my first thought is (in trying to defend my case here!) - maybe you were seeing the more extreme cases. Like, the more violent/aggressive anger-prone type people tend to be the ones who might end up in a psychiatric facility (?) 
But then, you were probably also seeing the people that were most likely to fulfill a suicide attempt. And those are the people we're talking about. (I assume, anyway - it could always be that the obvious angry guys are actually less likely to die from suicide and the more quiet, insular dudes tend to be the ones who make up more of the statistics - I have no idea, but I guess that's not unreasonable? You'd have more insight about that than I would, anyway. And something tells me that that isn't the case - like, if you're more aggressive, you might be more impulsive etc. I don't know?).

So you don't have to talk about any of your experiences there at all - but I am really curious like, was it *rare* to see a patient that *didn't* show anger - not even aggression - just some sort of anger?
In fairness, I'm sure a lot of guys who are suicidal do have something to be a bit angry about, like external events. (And it depends how you interpret what's ""aggression"" as well. And maybe there's a lower bar for men being perceived as aggressive etc etc).

But, I'm stuck on something I heard ages ago ""depression is anger turned inwards"". And tbh, that never really sat right with me. And maybe I'm swimming too deep here (for myself). But, is it just that some people will express things more outwardly (like anger, rage) and some will express that inwardly (like self-hatred, self-harm, depression) - I'm having trouble formulating what I'm trying to ask to be quite honest, it's not clear in my head. (I 've just had a few drinks ngl)

Anyway, I guess I'm not surprised that women are less aggressive than men (who are both suicidal in psychiatric care). I think it's just personal bias, tbh. Because I think I'm the opposite of that..... I dunno.
Maybe it's just I'm like wondering - are most men who experience suicidal ideation *really* like that? [And hey I'm sure its completely understandable a lot of the time - not to be endangering anyone, but to ""feel"" angry, sure]. I don't know.",t3_z73j2n

I would say 60% of the male referrals we received were “high risk.” There were women who made threats and things like that, but it would take a word or two, or even a nurse or two to settle them. Thing is, we got the referrals from the ER before they came to us. So, in those referrals they would share the histories of such patients. If during their current ER visit they needed physical/chemical restraint, showed extreme sexual deviance, or slapped someone up, we would either decline them or take them at extreme caution. The group that mostly fit this “exclusionary criteria” which is what we actually called it, were men. The men were also more likely to be homeless, or to have very little familial involvement due to their actions.

Had a few severely depressed and autistic ones who had been sexually inappropriate at home and so their families said no to taking them back. This was also an exclusionary criteria—meaning we don't take them. As you probably know, women are less likely to be diagnosed with autism (though they may still have it)because outwardly women do better at masking the symptoms, so this adds to my argument of men and women = different. One thing being in psych taught me is testosterone and yes estrogen, are helluva drugs.

That was just my facility though, but I think it was the same at most because we'd decline and the crisis workers would complain that nobody else wanted them either. Funny thing is, most of our psychiatrists were men and they had the final say in who got in and who didn't. I'm a firm believer that there needs to be more male-centric treatment methods and facilities. No matter what current society wants to sell, men and women are not the same. This is not to say that all suicidal men are angry, sexual deviants. But, it is to say that the ones represented in psychiatric facilities do tend to be and that experience colors my opinions. In my research and through my education, I have found that men tend to be more likely to externalize their problems, whereas women more likely to internalize which is why we see more men lashing out in visible ways, while equally troubled women get empathy because they might cry and inflict bodily harm on themselves. Not every man is one way, and not every woman is one way. A female patient once threatened to slap me, I kinda laughed her off because she was no threat. But, I had a 80 y/o male dementia patient who slapped his daughter so hard he dislocated her jaw. With all this said, I think it should be clear why women are iffy about getting involved on certain levels when it comes to men experiencing particularly powerful emotions. Women tend to have stronger non-familial support systems—like friends who they share everything with. I'm simply promoting men do the same.",t3_z73j2n

I've listened to men, I talk to men in my every day life, I have worked in a psychiatric facility where we declined men more often than women because men often come with a higher chance if physical engagement and we had a predominately female staff. For that reason, we were starting to hire more men, because boys/men NEED other men too. 

At some point, at least in my community, men would congregate in barbershops and talk their stuff. If a woman came in with her son, the conversation would change until she left.

Moreover, women do indeed have the tools and capacity to help effectively. Given that, isn't it cold hearted to say ""men should deal with their problems themselves""?

iy6qkci,t1_iy6dzto,"Yeah, I understand. Even though, men and women are indeed socialized differently and may even process things psychologically, they are not all THAT different.

Basically I am just saying that while primarily we are socialized differently based on gender, everyone is socialized differently. While men and women are probably not going to best suited to help each other with their own unique ""gendered"" experiences, there are some familiarities within the struggles that we may face throughout our lives.

This brings me to my main problem with the therapy and rejecting men in primarily women's institutions. I understand that there are definitely men that go into rage states (*drama* shows love to portray this) and it's not worth the risk. However, there is a fair portion of men that are not like that and generalizations like that hurt those men. This is one of the primary things that we are fighting for because angry feminists converted a lot of men's abuse shelters into women's shelters. They argue that they are ""harming women and taking away their resources for help"" and now we have women shelters that don't help men. That may not the case so much the case with your psychiatric facility and I'm glad that they are hiring more men therapists to help with this.

I know the exact same thing that you are talking about with the barbershop analogy. I think what you said was fair and men do understand the perspective a lot more.

iy7uwy9,t1_iy7gzea,"Thing is, I never said anything about women not helping AT ALL. I think some people here see a woman saying yeah I think men are better at that typically, and it's been taken as “f all you guys!” Another user mentioned that women should become more empathic towards men and I think that's a very doable and fair ask, everything else CAN follow. I hear men say that women dismiss their issues, or twist them into something nefarious, if that were to change I'm sure it'll be helpful, but that still won't mean that men shouldn't help men more.

I keep seeing something to the effect of “well men aren't comfortable helping each other emotionally so….” At least in America, we are very individualistic, it's going to be hard to sell anyone the “It's your responsibility to help your fellow man who has nothing to do with your overall life quality” idea. Is it “right” maybe not, but our world is filled with that sort of idea. Same as when women say “men don't protect us anymore,” random men on the subway or out and about. I've heard men say that either they were just trying to get on with THEIR day, or felt the situation was too volatile to get involved. The men or women who do are considered heroes of sorts because it's not the norm.

I think men's rights should decenter women. I've seen here some people say that women will assemble under the same cause, sometimes even wrongfully. The rad fem conversation doesn't rely on men to survive, it seeks to remove men actually. I'm not saying it should go this far, but I think in anything you have to look at the results that you want. Look at the ppl who have what you want and emulate it. You guys hate feminist, but some of the way they organize and cover one another could be useful in the Men's Rights arena. It'll never get there though unless women are removed from the discussion in unhelpful ways. How do you move forward if instead of empowering yourselves and each other, you ask “but where are the women? Women should help us since they're *stereotypically* better with emotions? As a man I feel more comfortable talking to women, they should help.”

To me, and say this respectfully, is an extremely disempowered state to live in. Those are literally all you problems. You cannot and will not be able to change others. The lack of empathy women have towards men will take decades to change, unless you want the performative social justice warrior kind, it can be done though. Asking all women to try/care/want to be an emotional tool to men goes as well as asking men to be a wallet/bodyguard for women in this day and age. Neither party likes it. Empathy though, that can be built naturally through a change in discussion I think.

I'll end by saying I'm saying everything respectfully. This is my true opinion, and it doesn't come from a place of malice. I tend to lean unemotional and try to remain sort of objective (as humanly possible given my personality traits), so please don't take any of this the wrong way. I care enough to have had these discussions with men, which is more than what most women do. I've taken an interest, but admittedly, there are places I feel I'm weak and I've seen men do better. Life isn't an rpg, I can't max out my relatability stat, lol though it would be nice if I could.

iy6t06u,t1_iy6qkci,"As for men in the ""rage states"" unfortunately, most men do not come out and speak about their mental duress. If they do, it's in echo chamber message boards, or they'll kinda sorta hint at it, but are less likely to cry the way a woman would--so it goes unnoticed until it gets really bad. Unfortunately, that may be why a good...60% of the male referrals we received were high-risk. They were more likely to slap nurses, some would whip out their penises and say ""suck it, I'm God."" With women, I can honestly say that never happened. This is not me saying that the women were better, women tend to lean manipulative and that comes with it's own issues, but it was something we could handle more than having a male patient on the floor who could get into real trouble with his manic behaviors. An 80 y/o with dementia punched a hole in his bedroom wall...heh. Nobody expected that sort of strength out of him because of his age, but yeah. His daughter came to visit and slapped her so hard she had to be sent to the ER. This is not to say that ALL male patients are violent, but maybe that by the time it gets to where we can easily see it, they're at the point, thus making it harder for regular (mostly female-led) facilities to treat them safely.

As for your last point, I think it's much easier to change oneself than to expect others to change. I totally agree that women should be taught to empathize with men more. I come here to try, but often I'm met with anger just for having a different opinion. Unfortunately, a lot of guys here miss that not every woman is a hateful feminist,and yeah, even if women are saying stuff that triggering to them they need to open the space for people to learn. Women are naturally more risk-averse. We're not going into the lion's den if we don't have to. Which is a big reason why I said men working with other men is important. If the psychiatric facilities aren't helping you, get your ass in there and help from the inside. I'm a black woman, and we face a lot of issues in our community. The ignorant ones among us are the ones crying about not getting anything, but not fighting for it either. You wanna stop going to jail for petty offenses more often than your other race peers, promote your kids, cousins, sisters, brothers to become lawyers and judges! Police getting you down, get more black faces in there so that black problems can be handled with more understanding and empathy. Women should learn to empathize better with men, again. However, it doesn't serve anyone in this world to get angry at what they can't change--others. Get more men into those facilities. Stop telling boys to only become firefighters and...lol another male-dominated field that I can't think of at this time. At my facility we were literally begging for male nurses. The same way women infiltrated and dominated certain fields from the inside is what men should do. Sadly, though, that can't be done until women are decentered in the conversation and real money moves are made. I say this with respect btw, I tell this to men, my fellow race members, and anybody else who feels bogged down by the system.

I think men's rights can take off if the whataboutism is dialed way back, and men do things the smart way, the way wars are fought in today's world--with paper. Get those degrees, certifications, and experience, that way no one can deny you certain experiences. Immigrants do it every day.

They are looking for help from people they don't trust, and who they have had terrible experiences with.

I work in psych, I acknowledge that the male voice is not as loud as it could be, that is where I think we should focus. Stop reading so much into it.

You're totally right to point at the individualist culture of North America. I remember reading something along those lines a few weeks ago. In other countries, men typically have a larger network of male friends that support eachother, and it could explain why there are a lot more mental health issues like depression in the US and Canada.

People go to doctors, and sometimes they get second opinions, and sometimes when they get a second opinion, their initial diagnosis can be wrong.

Edit: In case you're confused about the difference, when i state you are a selfish sexist asshole, i am basing that label off of the information you chose to present in this thread.

When you said i ""wasted your time crawling out of the dump of dry cum and empty hot cheetoh bags to address me"", you were trying to attack character that wasn't present in the thread, as i never mentioned eating cheetos or where i put my cum.

See the difference? (i doubt you will, but ya know, people are capable of growth and improvement, so i've heard)

Edit:

It was obvious to me, but i'll add the other example: Look how quick she jumps to attacking my sense of manhood. 

>  Such a man 😍😍😍😍

If i'm not acting to her satisfaction, i'm ""not a man"" or not a ""real man^tm"" in her head, and she uses that as a verbal attack.

Notice how nowhere in this thread did i imply she wasn't a woman due to how she was acting, but was in fact a sexist person evoking the same emotion as various smells (asshole, shitbag).

Women like this try to invalidate a man's ""manhood"" as a verbal attack, especially if there are other women around. It's like saying ""Wow bitch you're so ugly, no man would ever want to be around you!"" but for trying to control men's behavior instead of for looks.",t3_z73j2n

Funny how it has to be her telling us that, instead of them, huh?

> It upset you

Asserting without knowledge my emotional state, this is something they'll do IRL to try and rile you up. Remember, in their mind's if they can get you emotional, they ""win"", no matter how emotional she gets.

This is the attacking of men's emotions in action that we talk about, and the double standard of it.

> We agreed that men are best equipped to handle male issues

Notice how she doesn't include his perspective on _why_ he thinks that. I also agree that a man going to see a mental health professional would be best suited to find a male one, but that is because female providers are by and large incompetent and poorly (or adversely) trained when it comes to this, and i don't excuse them for that misandry.

It is quite akin to telling a rape victim to only see female therapists, if ""Well, you probably deserved it"" was in the handbook for therapists to respond with and that was the extent of empathy men could bother to muster, because that is the state we live in with majority women providers right now.

You are the sum of your 5 closest friends, after all, and so if someone is telling you the people they are around are entirely different than what they've presented to you, you know they are either one 1) lying about who they are, or 2) lying about the other people.

If women are allowed to have fears and anxieties, and men are not, how is that not a massive privilege and inequality in women's favor? Is it not a clear indication that stringent gender roles are also still being placed on men by women? Isn't it a very clear indication that women are, in fact, telling men to shut up about their problems, and that it's not something that's pushed onto men by other men or the patriarchy? Even ignoring the massive amount of misandric misrepresentation of male sexlessness, this still comes off as an extremely hateful, sexist and sociopathic approach to the issue.

I also wonder if the writers of this article have ever stopped to wonder if men who are systematically disenfranchised/vilified, or perpetually delegitimized/abused by women might have have some pretty legitimate reasons to be depressed, anxious or fearful. Maybe the crude and dehumanized manner in which they are treated by society, or women specifically, would leave them to be depressed, anxious and fearful.

iy7bb41,t1_iy6gk2l,"""My body , my choice , your responsibility.""",t3_z7evww
iy7mnpb,t1_iy6gk2l,"Exactly that. It's very simple to break down

1. Men cannot have sex without the risk of becoming a parent. The only way is to permanently remove their ability to have kids via a vasectomy. Condoms are only 97% effective (and can be easily tampered with). This even includes cases where women trick men into believing they are using protection, or cases where men are raped.

2. Women are the opposite. Women can have sex all they want without a single care of unwanted parenthood. They have abortion, plan B, heck if they bring it to term they can still dump it off no questions asked. 

So given the above two facts men are the only group legally and socially expected to take responsibility for sex. Despite BOTH men and women willingly going into the act knowing what the consequences may be. This is extremely plain discrimination.

Now we always get the typical feminist arguments back at this:

1. ""Well of course only she should get a say, she's the one who is pregnant. Her body her choice"" - Okay fine you can argue that. But if the decision on whether a child is born is hers and hers alone then so is the responsibility. No taxation without representation is it not?

2. ""Should have kept it in your pants"" - Ahh yes, the typical ""it's your fault for having sex"". Well that's funny because they never apply this logic to women. If a woman has sex and gets pregnant and doesn't want the child do these feminists say ""should have kept your legs shut""? No quite the opposite - they say that such language is misogynistic. That they are ""ruining her life over one night of sex"" and ""forcing her to be a mother"". Well if you're going to take that logic fine (although I disagree). But if the act of having sex should not condemn a woman to being a parent, neither should it for a man. Why is telling men that they need to accept the responsibility of sex and to avoid it altogether if they don't want the responsibility is okay, but telling a woman the same is ""misogynistic oppression"" and ""suppressing her sexual freedom""? It is funny how every single feminist argument is literally the pro-life argument. Seems feminists love pro-life arguments when it comes to getting men to fork over the bill.

3. ""It takes two to tango"" - This is just a thinly veiled way of saying ""you're responsible because you had sex"" (see point 2. for why that is stupid). But let's take this anyway. So because two parties were involved the responsibility should be shared equally? Okay. But then so should all the decisions. ""Two to tango"" should apply both ways - why should the mother get sole decision making when, after all, it takes two to tango. This is the fundamental flaw of the two to tango argument - it demands shared responsibility only in cases where it benefits the woman. If you're not going to apply the logic consistently then you don't have a leg to stand on.

I don't even have a dog in this fight as I got a vasectomy a while ago and have no plans of getting baby-trapped or the like. But the lack of logical consistency fucking infuriates my autistic brain.

You know I wish feminists would just admit the truth. ""We want women to be able to do what they want when they want but not men. We want men to be the good slave boys to fund the consequences"". Because that's effectively what this is. They want women to have the right to get out of parenthood whenever they want. But they don't want men having that right as it means some women will lose their meal ticket. 

Sorry ladies but it's quite simple - either both women and men should be able to opt out of parenthood post-sex, or neither should. Saying women should be able to get out of the responsibilities of sex whenever, while demanding men face those same responsibilities, is at best an extremely selfish and entitled attitude, and at worst literal supremacist ideology.",t3_z7evww

Creating an inherent predator/prey dichotomy even goes so far as to screw with the way consent is viewed as even expressing male desire within the context of an existing sexual relationship can easily be construed as emotional manipulation in an attempt to acquire consent. I've actually read articles that assert that the male/female power imbalance makes all consent a byproduct of coercion and therefore all sex between men and women is rape. Obviously that's an unreasonable take but it's not really a significant number of steps from ""men do sex to women,"" passing through ""therefore men are predators and women are prey,"" before a quick stop at ""obtaining consent is the socially acceptable hunting process"" and ending up at ""therefore all consent is invalid and any sex act between a man and a woman is rape by coercion at the very least.""

That they are ""ruining her life over one night of sex"" and ""forcing her to be a mother"". Well if you're going to take that logic fine (although I disagree). But if the act of having sex should not condemn a woman to being a parent, neither should it for a man. Why is telling men that they need to accept the responsibility of sex and to avoid it altogether if they don't want the responsibility is okay, but telling a woman the same is ""misogynistic oppression"" and ""suppressing her sexual freedom""? It is funny how every single feminist

I think a lot of feminists still operate under the impression that sex is something men do to women, and that women don't have much say in weather or not they have sex. They don't believe that sex can ever be truly consensual.

To begin with, your immediate problem is not extradition, but deportation.  Countries don't just let people arrive and live there, just like that.  This is where having a connection to another country might help - like if you are 1st generation American, you may be able to get residency through your parents.  You might even be eligible for citizenship - I believe grandchildren of Irish or Italian grandparents are eligible. There are some counties that will grant permanent residence for an “investment.”  There are some countries that will even sell citizenship for $150,000.  

Ok - so let's say you resolve your immigration issues.  Then the issue becomes - what you plan on doing to survive in that country?  You still need a roof over your head and food on the table. Do you know the local language? And don't assume that good paying jobs are plentiful in your new country.  Not to mention, you may have a considerably lower standard of living.

iy8ai8r,t3_z7gt9t,"In my experience
You'll owe for what you accumulated  due to your past debit.

Instance my support case was kinda like this . 
My ex husband paid me $136.00 dollars every few weeks for 2 sons when we divorced back in 2006. However he lapsed on his payments. So he accrued interest over the years.  I never went to court and really pushed it because $136 every few weeks is chump change, however it was court ordered. 
I paid for the divorce initially, 
Even went to court on his behalf when he got laid off and had it lowered down to like $56 a week , which he still lapsed on. Go figure.

Years later , my middle son turned 16 was becoming rebellious. 6'2 rebel nature isn't a good mix .
So I sent him to go to his father's full time.

I paid $436.00 a month due to my income gross at the time. Which was higher for just one kid. Than his court ordered payment for 2 kids. 

Now keep in mind he owed back support. From years of not paying.

So he still was required to pay me and I paid him. The state will not cross out your debit.  
If fact my child support was completed once my middle son graduated high-school.
He was still paying for his debit till my middle son was past 21. So my oldest was 23 then.
Best thing to do is contact the state and negotiate plausibly.

Guilt trip = Mental abuse = Serious enough reason to break up

You got vasec. She got pregnant. = Bitch cheated = Another very serious reason to break up.

DNA test is the very right thing to do.

I am ashamed that your ex is Not a wife material. And mistreated you. 

If a woman wants kids, but her man is not ready and gets vasec, she should comply and accept his final decision.

It's a disgrace for a woman to baby trap a man, especially with a baby that's Not his.

Ideological Subversion 

Everything you just described is by design - Not accident, and it would take roughly 15 - 20 years to reverse, as the seeds of society and influence are all planted in children through our F'ed up education system. The elite know that most parents don't have the time or resources to undo all the garbage they're filling your childrens heads with. 

But on top of this, the kids get hit with the agenda 24/7 - Hollywood, media in general/news, big tech, popular music, heck even advertising is in on it... How can we hope to compete with that. They have the combined resources of hundreds of billions of dollars and accumulative manpower to push children to march to their tune. 

If we want things to change, the machine described above and in that excellent video breakdown must be disrupted. Unless we find a way to do that, it will not change unfortunately. They've had an enormous head-start in slowly taking control of media/education/entertainment and big tech. IMO it'll take decades of dismantling before we can raise a generation of children that aren't being indoctrinated. 

Some believe that things will get so bad that the kids see through it on their own. I suppose that's possible - But look at how many adults go along with it willingly through cognitive dissonance.  Can't imagine kids will resist it en masse at a better ratio. Some can and will, and even do today. But not in enough #'s to make a difference to our future.",t3_z7h47n

It also causes double purchases, which is why bans were on board front the start with modern feminism.  They wanted to sell more cars, houses and so on.  This is why the whole ""break up the family"" shit started, breaking up a family leads to double the purchasers.  Shit, just read up on the Duluth rally lead up, it was originally an anti capitalism thing, they left blaming men and not capitalisms.  

The very last thing companies want is for women to be married, taken care of (provider/single bread winner), stay at home wives/moms.  It would be one of the biggest hits to a bottom line in history if just 1/3 of current working women pulled out of the work force as the number of purchasers would have a pretty big drop when it came to big things like loads for cars and houses, appliances, home repairs etc.  They liek being able to throw up houses fast and over price them, can't do that if suddenly 3 million more homes are empty because those women are living with a man instead of solo buying their own stuff as they currently do.

Feminists need to kind of wake up and realize they are just being taken advantage of as women, when they see media and corporate support, those companies don't see ""equal rights"", they see more people with spending power to advertise to.

Tertiary jobs usually have reserved spaces for women, meaning, they fill in quotas even if appliers are underqualified. So men gotta fetch a bone and do risky and hard work primary jobs and secondary jobs, but feminism doesn't like that because riskier jobs meant less people want to do them which meant more pay cause of higher demand. Now there's a surplus of men and the mysterious wage gap is forbidden. Those jobs diminish in value and pay pennies.

Conveniently, although feminism advocated for cushy office job quotas and in charge of Twitter's ""multicultural enrichment offices"" just to fill in empty quotas, they don't want to do any of the primary, secondary, or military jobs. So much so that all of a sudden feminism is overall against employment in primary and secondary sector when it comes to employment.

Then, what OP was more leaning towards, is the outdated law system that treats family relationships as if the mother is always a stay at home and the father is the bread winner, even if the father has full custody of the child, there are cases where the father still has to pay child support to the mother which makes no fucking sense because she doesn't have the child in the first place. It goes right into the ""party and shopping"" allowance.

I'm sure there are some who might agree with this extreme position, but I think it's a strawman of what male advocates *truly* want. If men's issues were simply treated on equal footing as women's, that would be sufficient. Make laws non-gender specific (circumcision requires the boy to be of legal age, men can be raped, close the sentencing gap, etc), have equal funding (homelessness, medical, domestic violence shelters, etc), take each group's concerns seriously and give reasonable priority to the most important problems each face, etc. That would basically destroy the current iteration of feminism, and shut down all the feminists  who argue that everything needs to be in their favour and that will somehow ""benefit men too"" (trickle-down femanomics), so men just need to join with them to ""smash the Evil Patriarchy"", and all men's issues will be magically solved.

When most MRA's say they oppose feminism, this is what they are talking about. ""Demolishing"" that ideology can be done by simply having a fair and just society, and leaving behind the vengeful ""It's **our** turn now!"" feminist aristocracy that's being created in its stead.",t3_z7j7e7

The leadership of this current iteration of The MRM has similarly refused to articulate their goals and desires in Plain Language, and then continually repeat those goals and desires.

It's not even that the number of female deaths has gone up, it's been going down, but the number of male deaths has gone down significantly more. So why have male deaths gone down more than female deaths since the 70s?

It's been well known for a long time that most domestic violence is mutual, both partners are violent. Around the 70s we started seeing a push to end domestic violence against women, and this included creating thousands of shelters specifically for women, but which exclude men.

If you have a couple, both are violent and both might just kill the other. What happens if you suddenly give one of them an out? One of them can now go to a shelter, and doesn't feel backed into a corner, while the other one is still stuck. Well, the one who has an out no longer has to resort to getting charged with murder, they can just leave so the partner who doesn't have access to shelters is less likely to be murdered.

By focusing exclusively on helping female victims of DV, feminists have created the situation by which women are more likely to be killed by a partner than men. This can be fixed by making shelters available to men. Do you think feminists would go for that, or will they just take advantage of the situation they caused and happily report that men are more likely to kill their partners than women, and let most people assume that this has always been the case?",t3_z7nzw7

https://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/59-6-6.pdf

> But since 2007, survey
and correctional data have indicated that the main perpetrators of prison sexual abuse seem
to be women. In men's facilities, inmates report much more sexual victimization by female
staff than by male inmates; in women's facilities, inmates report much higher rates of
sexual abuse by fellow inmates than by male or female staff

>  In the most recent National Inmate Survey, more than two thirds of men who reported sex with staff—68.8 percent—said that their staff perpetrators were exclusively women.40 Another 16.3 percent said that both male and
female staff had abused them. In total, 85 percent of male inmates who had had
sex with staff reported a female perpetrator.41 In women's prisons, too, the BJS data
suggest that women are more likely than men to perpetrate sexual abuse. Although
the staff members who have sex with women inmates are overwhelmingly male,42
incarcerated women report much higher rates of sexual abuse by other women
inmates than by male staff.43 Moreover, incarcerated women also reported much
higher rates of sexual coercion by fellow inmates than imprisoned men did.44

> Accordingly, “prison rape” as surveyed by the BJS is not
limited to forcible rape. Rather, it defines “sexual victimization” to include all forced,
pressured, or unwilling “oral, anal, or vaginal penetration; hand jobs; touching of
the inmate's buttocks, thighs, penis, breasts, or vagina in a sexual way; . . . and
both willing and unwilling sexual activity with staff.”47 Its surveys ask respondents
in candid language about sexual touching,48 “handjobs,” “oral sex or a blowjob,” and
vaginal and anal penetration by the penis or with an object.49 If an inmate says he
or she has been sexually victimized, the survey asks whether he or she was physically forced, pressured, or “made to feel you had to” engage in these forms of sexual
activity

> this Article takes the position that staff–inmate sex is rightly counted
as sexual “abuse” or “victimization” even if no force is used, and the inmate seeks
or agrees to it. Readers who remain unconvinced of this might nonetheless
agree that the gender of the “willing” inmate or staff partner does not resolve
questions of consent. It is not safe to assume that staff–inmate sex is necessarily
benign when the inmate is a man and the staff member is a woman. Yet, as I
note in Part IV, this assumption is quite common in prison rape discourse. It is
only in the context of sex between male inmates and female staff that the
inmate's presumed willingness is proffered as a reason to ignore or discredit
inmates' allegations of sexual abuse.75 In any case, the survey data demonstrate
that, at a minimum, women staff are taking sexual advantage of incarcerated
men and boys to a degree that seems surprising, in light of conventional gender
expectations. Regardless of whether it is as coercive as sex between male staff
and women inmates, sex between women staff and men inmates warrants more
attention than it has received in prison rape discourse to date",t3_z7nzw7

But a good counter point is, 100% of paternity fraud is committed by women, **100%**, and this occurs at a significantly higher rate (est. 1 in 3 fathers are raising a child not thier own, under the impression the child is theirs), causing some very serious long term damage like mental and financial, which can effect a ton of aspects of life",t3_z7nzw7

I think for that we would need to know how many of those 1,958 suicides were men, which this post doesn't provide. Sure, in general men commit suicide more often, but the numbers might be a bit close.

Here's part of their conclusions :

> > Among all the results already reported, perhaps the most striking and important surrounds the trends in intimate partner homicide, particularly in the context of ongoing efforts to curtail domestic violence. Some researchers argue that the reduction in male intimate partner victimization, a decline of nearly 60% over the past four decades, is because of an increase in the availability of social and legal interventions, liberalized divorce laws, greater economic independence of women, as well as a reduction in the stigma of being the victim of domestic violence. Although at an earlier time a woman may have felt compelled to kill her abusive spouse as her only defense, she now has more opportunities to escape the relationship through means such as protective orders and shelters (Dugan et al. 1999; Fox et al. 2012). As a tragic irony, the wider availability of support services for abused women did not appear to have quite the intended effect, at least through the 1980s, as only male victimization declined.",t3_z7nzw7

> Although men, historically and cross-culturally, are the dominant sex, they possess remarkably weaker in-group bias than do women. In four experiments, we found this sex difference persisted using both implicit and explicit measures, despite using a gender attitude IAT that was unconfounded with gender stereotypes… we can claim with confidence that even when men are responding automatically, their in-group bias is surprisingly frail and that women's in-group bias is particularly strong at the implicit level (i.e., stronger than men's by a factor of 4.5).

.

> Goodwin, also a member of Purdue's Women Studies Program, teamed with Laurie Rudman, professor of psychology at Rutgers University, to conduct four studies measuring implicit attitudes of 379 adults. Their results show that women prefer women, and men, on average, don't have a preference toward either gender. Although men, on average, did not show in-group favoritism, individual men's responses varied widely, with some men showing a preference for women and others showing a preference for men… The results showed that women showed in-group favoritism four times greater than men. Those figures are based on an average of separate studies that involved research groups of varying sizes.

- They suck at single motherhood.

- They are selfish and entitled.

- Their taste in men sucks big time and they always pick a douchebag who will cause some type of abuse on the kid.

- They have the insolence to isolate the kid from the father.

- They have the insolence to use the kid as a golden mine and emotional dumpster.

- They are negligent and won't help the kid in need.

- They are abusive emotionally/physically or both.

By the way my mother was the same as your ex wretch. Stole custody, took advantage of my vulnerable underage ass, let her new idiot sexually abuse me and had the insolence to ask me if I like it. Bitch was negligent, cheated on my father with many men and had no regrets.

Sex itself is an aggressive act and tissues are damaged, yet women don't complain about it when they enjoy it. The issue is a woman's subjective feelings which are influenced by many factors and which conflict with the reality of biology.

There doesn't seem to be any attempt to determine why a pandemic of violence is happening and thus to work out how to ameliorate the cause, only a determination that violence is happening and the knee-jerk impulse to stop it by using the traditional deterrent of punishment against the accused. Punishment does not deter in emotional situations because primitive emotions aren't mediated by reason very effectively: a woman is not worrying about going to prison when she slaps a man, or tries to rake out his eyes, or knee him in the groin, for example.

The article keeps oscillating between violence and abuse, depending on which supports the particular narrative at the time.

You two do have very different viewpoints. Saying that no one should dismiss another based on “differing opinions” trivializes the differences you two have. It's a value system and you live your life based on your values. She's not dismissing you as a person but as a romantic partner and she's probably right in that you do not share the same values, unless you think there was some kind of misunderstanding. 

What she said about republicans is not correct, but I would be interested to know the real reason she feels that way. I'm an independent as well, and know a lot of republicans. I've heard the same vitriol from that side about democrats. When I talk to them about why they feel that way, it's usually because they feel personally slighted by policies the dems want to enact (or already did). From my experience, it's more of a venting of frustration, fear and anger, especially if they're with someone they feel they can vent to. She felt that was you in this case. This is a divisive time, and it affects relationships. People of all political affiliations feel their rights are being taken away, fearful of the economic situation, war, etc. Fear makes people feel strongly and can hinder rational thinking and increase black and white thinking. 

Also I think there are some beliefs that do need to be entirely dismissed as nonsense as well as the people that hold those beliefs.

The kind of guy that is everything they ask for, isn't the kind of guy they're attracted to.  So, for the feminists wanting an LTR, they've really painted themselves into a corner where they can't win.

If I can offer some advice, back in my dating years, I mostly just listened closely for them repeating any feminist rhetoric and depending what it was, nexted them discretely.    I figured it was pretty pointless to ask straight up, ""do you consider yourself a feminist"" or something similar.    A victim mindset was one red-flag.  Always blaming men was another.  

One of the keys that helped me understand women better was when I realized they have an internal struggle/dissonance/contradiction:  They have a desire to try to control the man in their relationship, but they're only attracted to men they can't control.

iycioyw,t3_z88sme,"I had one of these.

6 months I was dating a fairly prominent doctor and professor at a University.  Indian woman.  She was beautiful, successful, and absolutely brilliant.  In my experience, it seems that Indian women are either ultra feminine or ultra hardcore feminists as a rule.  She was also a pretty hardcore feminist, though we never discussed politics at all.  

I booked a weekend at a luxury cabin in the woods on a lake.  It was perfect.  We planned a weekend of hiking, campfires, kayaking, and general outdoor activities.  Keep in mind that we were deep in the woods and on the borders of militia/nutter territory.

Second day, morning.  We were going for a dawn walk down the dirt road leading to the cabin when she wanted to explore a side path.  We walked about 50 yards down the path when we came to a fence surrounding a compound with multiple buildings and vehicles.  It had a gate that had signs that said ""Keep out, this means you"" and ""This property protected by the Second Amendment"".

I immediately told her we needed to go back, for what I thought were obvious reasons.  She wanted to keep going.  I told her they wouldn't tolerate me going on their property, and they certainly weren't going to tolerate her doing it.  Apparently that was the trigger.  

When we got back to the cabin, she went on a two-hour-long tirade calling me a sexist, racist, misogynist and assuring me that she didn't need a man to take care of her.  I heard every single talking point in the feminist manifesto that morning trying to talk her down and save the day and weekend.  She was completely out of control though.  I finally stopped trying to be understanding and fought back.  No one accuses me of those things.  She had no concept of the potential danger she had been in and was mad at me because I told her no.

This is something I know so well. I've had friends end up like this. If you try and rationalise them they'll say how privileged I am because I'm a man and that I won't understand.

I also had an ex who did this. She self described herself as a justice warrior. Completely turned me off her (along with the cheating, but she did that later) because she would always get upset at the littlest things.

We are now in fourth-wave feminism which started somewhere in the 2010s. 

The Duluth Model was created in the early 80s from a study conducted by feminist in Duluth Minnesota in 1981. Which places it firmly at the tail end of the second-wave feminist movement.

The ladies fight for the truth - their own, imaginary truth.They rarely give up that truth, though they will publically deny it for the sake of resolving the argument.

iybe3m5,t1_iyanqly,"I can sort of see what you are saying, I also see why they think the way they do. I do think there is a level of resentment in MGTOW towards women for not being the way we want them to be and lets face it most guys in that movement have been hurt by women who can be extremely cruel, much crueler than most men can comprehend and its a response to the pain caused. I empathize and do not hold it against anyone that feels that way but yes it is definitely based on a foundation of resentment and pain.

Put it this way, if they found the perfect woman for them that made them happy, would they identify as part of that group?

If I had to put a label on myself it would I suppose be an involuntary MGTOW that also sees men's rights as important in the current climate in that I am at an age where the women I am interested in are no longer interested in me.

I do not intentionally avoid them, I do not hate or blame them for their inherent behaviors, it is the way it is. There is a lot of the behaviors that MGTOW point out that I absolutely believe.I still do not hate women and if one who I was attracted to came into my life then I would never say never & there are some experiences being in a relationship where you are so emotionally connected that you cannot replicate being single & I don't care how expensive the prostitute is:)

I do not intentionally exclude myself however the women that are interested in me would bring a net negative effect to my current happy life (perceived) & so I have never allowed any interactions to advance to a romantic level even though I know they would have been an option.

So I would never intentionally walk away from women but for me to be romantically involved with one now, they would be of a quality that I am unable to attract. I am realistic & accept this and carry on with my life.

I do not think you can put people into any one category and then judge them, it is just not that simple and anyone that decides to follow something like MGTOW and exclude decisions or desires because it does not follow the rules of that methodology are just being disingenuous to themselves.

It all boils down to a relationship with a woman is a big risk and many men have decided the risk is not worth the effort no matter who the woman is. I do not subscribe to that at all.   
If mens rights had some success in making the laws fair around divorce and custody, I think you would find MGTOW and groups like them would evaporate overnight because the risk comes back down to one worth taking for many.

Nine times out of 10 it's the men who are forced to pay alimony and child support. You can try to argue all you want but it's the truth. I know a man who got divorced after 28 years because his wife announced that she was having an affair and left him.

 He was still forced to pay her alimony and he gave her $30,000 to start over on top of that. She spent all of it in a month and still took him to the cleaners. Meanwhile he had to struggle. Safe to say I despise her to this day. This has nothing to do with women getting raped or murdered by their partners which is unfortunate and is a very real thing. That's not at all what he was talking about though.

 Men are also victims of this sort of thing whether people want to acknowledge it or not. Men can also be victims of domestic violence and unfortunately we still have a lot of catching up to do in terms of acknowledging this. So yes, men face worse consequences than women do in terms of having their lives ruined financially and socially.

 A man is labeled a rapist whether or not he actually did it and even when a woman recants her story, he's still labeled as such. Their entire lives can be ruined over a woman being bitter or just being selfish because they think they're entitled to a man's money. I could go on...

ETA: I'm a woman and I fucking hate it when women do that. One or a few men have hurt them so now suddenly all men are the enemy. I could think the same way because I'm a woman who is a survivor of domestic violence at the hands of a man. I'm able to think objectively and not view all men as the enemy. 

Feminists are brainwashed and clearly unable to think for themselves. They think that because a few men have hurt them, all men are the enemy. Then they wonder why  men want nothing to do with them. They don't see the irony that it's their own bad attitude that keeps these men away.

I talk in the book about the difference between idiot compassion and wise compassion, and idiot compassion is where you want to make somebody feel better, and so you don't necessarily tell them the truth. And wise compassion is where you really hold up the mirror to them, in a compassionate way, but you also deliver a very important truth bomb. ""

I'm also curious as to what, if any, research has been conducted into whether or not women today currently have fewer friends than they did even in the early 2000s. The explanation for all of this could be quite simple: Beginning the late 2000s, when YouTube, Facebook, and streaming services became ubiquitous, EVERYONE(men and women alike)began spending less time outside, and more time glued to our keyboards and IPhones

If this is the case, one has to wonder what contemporary activists want the government to do in order to fix this problem. Isn't this something we can handle on our own, by spending less time online and more time socializing out in reality?",t3_z8a6ya
iycznnr,t3_z8a6ya,"I think there are a few pressures on men that prevent them from forming friendships.

First of all, work culture has shifted dramatically. You can't easily be friends with people in the workplace. I can't have close friendships with my make co-workers, because then I'd need to include my female co-workers and that isn't appropriate because I am a married man, and even if I wasn't, it's wrong to get into intimate relationships with the people you work with.

Second, many men (thankfully not me) have pressure from their wives to have the ""right"" friends, who are often the husbands of their female friends. This can work, but ultimately that puts you at the whims of your wife and her friends, which isn't ideal.

Third, male exclusive social spaces have been destroyed or integrated. This means it's very difficult to get away on a regular schedule without it looking like infidelity.

Fourth, many men will have trouble hanging out with their single friends if they are themselves married. Married men often have their friend groups curated by their wives, who will have Opinions about who is appropriate for their husbands to hang around with.

Fifth, many men are whipped (by either their wives or bosses) into working very long hours which makes it difficult to maintain a social life.

Additionally, there are a number of social pressures that don't come from women specifically the contribute:

We have gone from a society where we have to be friends with the people who live near us (our neighbors) to one where we can be friends with exclusively those who share our interests. Friend groups have very little diversity as a result, meaning the friend groups we DO build for ourselves kind of suck.

Suburban life has us living isolated on our tiny island homesteads and driving in our individual cars to the places we want to go. It's difficult to interact with people we meet with when both are in a car driving past each other, and the next house over is far enough away that you probably have little to no interaction with them. There is no need to learn to live politely.

Modern life has little place for the extended family. It's common now for children to go years or decades without talking to their parents, and when you turn 18 you leave the house and HAVE to support yourselves.

So you get men with no friends, men with friends who are all ideologically being pushed to an extreme due to lack of diversity, men with no meaningful family connections (and if they live at home into adulthood that's seen as shameful), and they have no organizations to join or places to go other than work.

I think the answer is to put families together into communal living, where parents and grandparents can  assist with the raising of children and the elderly can be supported in the way they need too. I think the answer is a renewal of fraternal systems and community groups/services so people can go and get to know their neighbors. The answer is college fraternities, freemasonry, ham radio clubs, block parties, and community events that are more than some local businesses setting up tables. It's wives allowing their husbands to do these things and helping them figure out logistics, and bosses giving men the day off to go do them every now and then.",t3_z8a6ya

Here's the reality: life is hard. It may not always be demanding in the same ways as our societies change over time, but it is always hard. How do we deal with hardship? Successful people overcome it, and unsuccessful people fall before it. The value structure formed by that reality is inescapable, and social expectations are downstream from these inherent rules of life. 

Men certainly suffer from this problem disproportionately when it comes to expected stoicism. But we aren't the only ones suffering. Women bear similar burdens. When being a wife and mother were the social expectations, women had to compete to find a man who could be a good provider. These days they are experiencing demands that are more traditionally male, where they are expected to pay their way and keep themselves fit for duty.

Surviving the hardships of life requires stoicism and determination. These attributes are innately encouraged, and the same forces that encourage these attributes discourage certain healthy values like openness and taking the necessary time to deal with your mental health.

iyc3il6,t1_iybif7b,"Just leaving the following quote here for anybody that doesn't recognize that this is by design: The quote discusses Sally Miller-Gehart's essay titled 'the future - if there is one - is female':

> Gearhart does not base this radical proposal on the idea that men are innately violent or oppressive, but rather on the ""**real danger is in the phenomenon of male-bonding, that commitment of groups of men to each other whether in an army, a gang, a service club, a lodge, a monastic order, a corporation, or a competitive sport.**"" Gearhart identifies the self-perpetuating, male-exclusive reinforcement of power within these groups as corrosive to female-led social change. Thus, if ""**men were reduced in number, the threat would not be so great and the placement of species responsibility with the female would be assured.**"" Gearhart, a dedicated pacifist, recognized that this kind of change could not be achieved through mass violence. On the critical question of how women could achieve this, Gearhart argues that it is by women's own capacity for reproduction that the ratio of men to women can be changed though the technologies of cloning or ovular merging, both of which would only produce female births. She argues that as women take advantage of these reproductive technologies, the sex ratio would change over generations.

iydijp5,t1_iycznnr,"Per workplace I think it's also important to note that back in the day you built a long career at a company, and that made it far easier to have male friends in the workspace. This could and did lead to ""boys clubs"" however, so there's some good and some bad.

Regardless, nowadays the concept of career progression through loyalty is dead. IF you want your career to progress, the best way to do it is to jump between different companies to move up. You can't have long-lasting friendships if the average person stays employed only 5 years at one company before moving elsewhere. That makes it much harder to make deep friendships, and almost impossible to keep them.

Given that work is one of the strongest pillars of male identity, the very thing that men identify the most with is now set up in such a way to sabotage instead of strengthen male friendships.

Completely agree with you on suburban isolation, and it makes it even worse when you have entire neighbourhoods where all families are more or less the same age group, since that isolates the grandparents. We no longer have multigenerational contact, and it's been especially devastating due to covid. 

I don't have any solutions to present really, but at the very least talking about the problem and making it known as a problem is the first step to solving it.",t3_z8a6ya

* Being a victim of a crime. Women are far more likely to have resources available to them. 

* Being struck by poverty. Women have far more government resources dedicated to pulling them out of poverty. Women have gender-specific free housing programs to help them avoid becoming homeless.

As it stands in Australia as of 2011, Parental Leave Pay provides eligible working parents (only one parent is eligible, usually the birth mother) with up to 18 weeks of pay at the rate of the national minimum wage. Dad and Partner Pay provides eligible working dads or partners with up to two weeks pay at the rate of the national minimum wage.

So as it stands, parental leave is sexist in policy and application.

The Bill being introduced by the Labor government was developed by the Women's Economic Equality Taskforce, a special task force established to provide advice to the Australian Government to support the advancement of women's economic equality and achieve gender equality, focused on driving women's economic equality as economic imperative, informing the National Gender Equality Strategy, and providing strategic advice on key issues arising from the Jobs and Skills Summit. The task force is comprised entirely of women, is focused on women and only considers the needs and experiences of men when it benefits women.

Then the solipsism continues with basically arguing that then the mother/significant other would need to watch her own kids - which is a subjective argument down to the couple; if the railworker (presumably a man) brings in more earnings, it makes sense that he wouldn't be the one to take time off (if not paid time off for it).

""26 Weeks Partial Income Replacement: Unlike employees in other industries, rail employees who are unable to work due to sickness, after a waiting period, receive up to 26 weeks of partial income replacement — under a federal law known as the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA). Railroad employers solely finance RUIA sickness benefits.  
 Supplemental Sickness Benefit: In addition to RUIA benefits, some rail employees receive, at the railroads' expense, a supplemental sickness benefit that increases the income replacement rate above the RUIA rate (to approximately 70% of daily pay) and extends the period of payment to a maximum of 52 weeks. Other rail employees receive paid sick days.

I don't think caring for children is inherently suffering and I think being alienated from that labour is one of the big ways that men suffer in the modern world. But I can agree that being forced to care for children is also a suffering. Giving a male dominated field more options to care for children would be good for both genders.

Why can't the woman just also work, so they can afford external childcare? It works fine here in the Nordics. If the woman wants to be a stay at home mom, it's included in the deal.

I never said that fathers should not take care of their children and spend time with them. In the scenario set out by the original OP,  the man is working all day, but should instead have less time there and spend that time on childcare (not just spending time with) instead of the women. Again, there's no relief for the man.

That scenario is so extremely rare in this situation, that it practically doesn't exist. It's just for goodwill with male feminist and gay couples. No thought is given to those 95% male workers(regardless of sexual orientation).",t3_z8e8iw
iyd0amd,t1_iycwq92,"The problem is choice. Or the lack of it. The big issue is at the moment the system makes a lot of assumption on how will make what choices. 

Ideally, men and women could decide among themselves if they want the man to do all the childcaring, the women to do it, or split it in some ratio. And the world of work would be structured to allow and enable those choices.

But for most people it isn't. In the nordics it is better. But not perfect.

But again, childcare is zero sum game. if couple want children, then some amount of childcare must be done. Having a child IS a burden, it takes a lot of time and effort not just in childcare but in making money to support that childcare. The division of that Labour is something the couple should be able to decide among themselves. The issue is the railroad worker contracts ASSUME that SOMEONE ELSE will do ALL the childcare. The OP is saying that this assumption hurts not only the men doing most of the money making work, but the woman doing most of the caregiving by removing the CHOICE from both of them.

If the parties then decide the man will use that time off to do something other than childcare then that's fine. The point is the current system doesn't let the family make any choice at all.",t3_z8e8iw

It may not have been inside of him, but it was still a part of him. I can imagine that upon first finding out he might have been struck with countless expectations. Little fantasies about fatherhood.

Is it really just this? From my understanding people don't ask how dads cope with newborns as well, yet they seem to be calling everyone who lets the mother do her fair share of work ""deadbeat dad"". Seeing you have kids, you should know what I'm referring to.

At some point we just have to accept that men will never have sufficient emotional support in live, and it's on us to develop further coping mechanisms to deal with that alone, all while having to be the rock for your wife/kids/whatever.

iydy8vz,t3_z8hlnu,"We too had a miscarriage before our first child was borne. It was much earlier than yours, six-eight weeks. My wife was, of course, devastated but it also took me very off guard how much grief I experienced. We had been trying and invested in having a child and to loose our little one even before we could meet them was very hard. 

No one from my family, most of my coworkers or friends, really asked or (most likely) thought I had any trouble with it. Or if they did no one ever said anything or asked how I was. I think the only person who has ever actively asked was after one of my bosses asked asked how my wife was and, likely, observed I was tearing up talking about it. 

We talked a bit and about it but it's not something most men feel comfortable deeply discussing even if we care or want to offer support. 

After that I did talk about it with friends and family and have brought it up to others online before. I actively raised it as a topic when talking about kids and pregnancy and family life. 

I have felt like it's an active effort that I want to do; not only to offer other fathers support but to alert people that men feel this loss too. We are hurting. We have to be strong and supportive but we need some help too at times.  And yes, we want our wife supported and want to help offer her all the help we can but we too need a hand at times and love our children, born and unborn, as well. 

That's also the point at which I started having lots of issues with my previous ‘neutral' position on abortion. It's hard to claim an unborn child is not alive when you have children and are actively involved seeing pregnancy and childbirth. They carry over traits and habits observable in utero. You can see how they sleep, how they move, how they hiccup and facial features. I don't see how so many women with kids can ignore that and actively work against it.",t3_z8hlnu

iyeqtwk,t3_z8hlnu,"First off, I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. I can't even imagine your grief.

Second, you're not wrong in that nobody considers your feelings on this matter, but I say ""fuck them"". 

I think you should go and see a mental health therapist who specializes in grief, and you should see them on your own. Your wife should see one on her own too - preferably a different one than you are going to. 

If you go as a couple to this grief counseling, you run the very real risk of not having any focus on your own grief, and while your wife needs help, so do you. You need to go and get it.

Some friends of mine lost a child recently, and each parent is seeing a separate counselor, and eventually, they'll see one together as a couple. This was my wife's advice to them (my wife is a licensed clinical mental health counselor who cannot see them professionally for ethical reasons because they are friends of ours) specifically to see separate counselors. 

BOTH you and your wife need a safe space with a counselor to work on your own individual grief, without any sort of pressure or input from the other while in that safe space. This is not an indictment of you and your wife as a couple - it's making sure that you both get the therapy that you both need. No two people grieve the same, no two people have the same issues in moments like this, so both people need to get the individual treatment and therapy that they need. If you both were in a car wreck and you broke your arm and she broke her leg, they wouldn't treat only one of you, right? They wouldn't give you both the same treatment for your different injuries, right? The same applies to the grief counseling you both need. 

It may not be super easy to find a therapist that will address your grief in an appropriate way, here are a couple things to look out for when looking for therapists. 

Red flags to watch out for with your counselor:

1) If they want to see you as a couple, rather than on your own.

2) If they spend more time reminding you to comfort your wife than helping you specifically through your own grief.

3) If they say anything like ""Well imagine how your wife feels right now, at least you're not going through THAT!""",t3_z8hlnu

The ugly truth is that humans are just not set up to deal with men's emotional pain. You can be pissed off or happy and people will know how to absorb it. Anything else, and they don't know what to do with it. I have seen groups of men, who have been good friends for years, look away embarrassed when one of their buddies breaks down in tears.  Women are a little better in the those same circumstances., but not by much. The only time I have seen men comforting other distraught men, is (oddly enough) in the military.

After that, if the physical, mental, emotional and even financial health of the mother is in danger, then abortion done in the most painless way possible.

HOWEVER, men's physical, mental, emotional and financial health should also be considered. If a man can not or does not want to “parent” a child, he should be allowed to do a “paper abortion” as some have said. Where he is released from ALL financial or legal obligations to that child.

Equality is about everyone getting the same deal. If women can “choose not to parent”, then men need to have that same power too.

That being said the girls in twox said that it was entirely the man's responsibility if he got a girl pregnant. They said you should always wear a condom (good advice generally), but that wasn't what I was asking. I followed that with I mean if the condoms fail and she ends up pregnant. That was met with a line of hate even though I had been respectful the whole time never arguing just asking questions for their perspective. One said that it was entirely a man's fault. That there's only one sure fire way to get pregnant, so I put a cloak on and said isn't that what we get mad at Republicans for saying to women? After that I was called a misogynist and people started saying it's too bad that we are biologically disadvantaged that we have to pay child support regardless if we want the child or not. (To be clear I would be there for my child, but that being said the hypocrisy is unreal). They will use the bodily autonomy argument and sure pregnancy is risky for mothers, but if I was forced to have a child I'd have to go from 2 to 3 jobs. I'd have to sacrifice my mental and physical health for a very long time until I made it high enough in my main job. I dunno it just seems like a faulty argument if you take the nuance in.

I dunno I hate the double standards that come with abortion. It always takes two to make a baby... unless we start making lab babies.

For the most part in this day and age birth control is good enough at preventing pregnancy that it becomes self evident that women are deciding to become pregnant under the guise of accidental pregnancy. The overturning of that court decision in the USA is a massive blow to mens rights because now many women will not have the option of abortion even if they didn't want to hold that over the alleged fathers head.

It's a tricky thing to balance though because of the fact that women can and do fall pregnant accidentally, no form of birth control is 100% effective. The act of recreational sex (as opposed to procreational sex) can lead to pregnancy despite the intentions and consent of the participants and this is why the government often intervenes so the father is locked into this “slavery”.

If you mean men are put under financial obligation for the child, the next paragraph & sentence is what I said about Child Support from another post about abortion.

One thing I never have understood with (us) adults is, in consensual situations (not involving rape), men have this resistance about paying child support. Like, they're upset that they're responsible for their actions or something. And the fact that the statement or complaint ""I don't want to pay child support."" exists, is a symptom or effect of not asking the question ""What if you/I get pregnant?"" I get it's a real mood killer or if you're in that part of the relationship where you're still getting to know each other. But it's stupid how heated men get about this. And if you're thinking to yourself ""Well it's my money!"" Okay, think of it like payment to not being involved. At the very least, do you think that child deserves to eat or go to daycare? How is a mother supposed to take care of a child while she's working a 9 to 5 job?

Since we are finding the ""least bad option"" and we don't care if we are being unjust then why can't we force a rich guy to pay, or force the shops to give free products etc?

Even if we only consider those 3 options.  The third option is what would be just. for 3 reasons

1. because you pay taxes to guarantee people's rights
2. Because you allow the mother to have a child that she cannot support and prevents the father from forcing her to abort.
3. Because you are the one that don't want a child in poverty

In fact, there is already a consensus in society that the third is the correct one. That's why nobody has a problem with government financing adoption houses, help to single mothers, police etc. Instead of forcing the nighbor, the relative or whoever to do it

So this is literally a slavery argument ""I want X but i don't want the tax payer to pay for it so let's force someone to do it for free

In fact this is also sexist, because if we aceept this path of ""tax payer paying for it is unnaceptable"" what would be logical, is to force women who can't support their children and are having them against the father consent to abort.

Just because they are unborn they aren't important? Do you suggest children in general aren't important? Would you care if a born baby was slaughtered?

>Do you know how difficult it is to get that surgery? 

I imagine very difficult. I mean you are getting an unnatural surgery. But it's either that or just not have sex, and I know for a fact not every woman that wants an abortion has been raped.

>Some women choose to have abortions, and then later have children. In that point of their life, they were not ready to have a child. That would stop them ever having children. 

And somehow she has the right to chose when to have a child but the unborn child doesn't get the right to chose when to be born.

>What of the woman's rights? What of cases of: - Rape? - Incest? - If the pregnant person is a child? - If the woman is in a domestic violence situation? - If she is in poverty?

None of this is the child's doing or their fault. They didn't rape the woman, they didn't commit incest, they aren't the abusers, these children are completely innocent in all of these situations. 

Abortion is equivalent to the death penalty, we are literally treating these children like serial killers for things that they *didn't* do.

Also, adoption exists for a reason, so does foster care. It may not be much but it's better than nothing. If poverty is a problem then why are we killing children instead of fighting for a less greedy government?

>Actual humans matter more than potential humans. While it is in her body, it is her choice and should always remain that way.

It has been made clear in law, that my role regarding the pregnancy is non existent. I have zero input regarding how the pregnancy proceeds. I therefore have zero responsibility for the outcome.

>You dont want children then keep your sperm to yourself because at the end of the day it's the man who initiates the pregnancy process by giving up his sperm.

Again, a pregnancy is not a child. There is no child until it is born as a result of the singular unilateral choice of the mother. It is inherently unjust to hold an individual legally responsible for the choices made by another person.

But i dont even feel the whole cost should be on the guy. It takes 2 to make a baby. So dont even think the whole financial burden should be placed on 1 side. If you dont make it work and have a kid, you should not have all the benefits like yea still in a relationship with the person. Have all yea bills paid and have all yea life style provided for. It should be only to help the kid. So anything over 300 to 400 is bullshit. You're not there to pay all her bills wail she is no part of yea life. The nasty thing is that the kids are used as weapons cause if the kid fully lives with mom true the court always makes the man pay much more. And often barely gets to even see the child. And see so often that the mom just moves far away to make it, seeing the child for the man almost impossible. If that is not cruel, i dont know what it is. Be people only complaining about where all the good men are. The system has failed them, and the stopped being good it provides more to be the bad guy than the good man.

iydsje4,t3_z8n5xp,"Avoiding a bias is different from raising awareness of a bias.  Both have their place, but they are not the same.   

In terms of raising awareness on an individual basis, the first step IMO is to understand an issue.   For example, what feminists were saying about the wage gap didn't ring true to me.  So first, I made sure I understood their position, then I learned what the wage gap actually supported and what studies showed were the actual (non discriminatory) causes.  I also learned about relevant, related issues such as the equal pay act.  So now when someone says women are paid less for the same work as shown by the pay gap, I can point out that's not what the pay gap shows and can show paying women less for the same work is illegal.  

I think the next step is to learn how to articulate the issue to others clearly and in ways that avoid common mistrusting.   Posting in venues like this can help with that, or talking to an open minded friend.   

I think the next step is whom to engage and when.   Posting here is good practice but here you are mostly preaching to the choir. Arguing with feminists is typically a lost cause since they care about their agenda, not facts.  For maximum impact, you want to reach those who are unaware but open.    

An example:   Someone brings up how they read how boys aren't doing as well in school. I reply:  “yeah, it's too bad we've passed policies that actively discriminate against males in education.”   Hopefully they respond with an interest in leaning specifically what that discrimination is.  

Similarly, one can post comments after articles.  An article may talk about how boys are discriminated against in school.   I may reply in the comments:  “great article describing the discrimination against males in education, but it's too bad the author failed to address policies such as WEEA that created much of this discrimination.”",t3_z8n5xp

iygq65r,t1_iygkt26,"I think the argument of the women's team been less good and been destroyed by the men's team is fallacious. Soccer is a physical sport, of course men will have the upper hand. They will run faster and kick harder.
Is that a reason to being paid more? Did they train harder? Did they put more hours in preparing for the competition?
Take another sport, triathlon for example. A woman could train more, sacrifice more, and will still lose tho a man who did less. Does that mean her winning the women's category is less important and have a smaller prize? I don't think so. She's the best in the world amongst women.

Now you're also say they bring less money, so it's would just not be possible to have a similar prize. That's a valid point. But how much advertising is made about the men's World Cup, compared to the women's one? That also have an impact on viewership.

2. Would a woman doing that choose to have a boy? Probably not, as she thinks women are better and she doesn't need men, so she'll have a girl. Choosing ""positive"" characteristics like that and eliminating the bad genetics (essentially the Y chromosome) is pure eugenism. It could even be considered genocide.

The “but it benefits kids” argument doesn't fly in any other kind of fraud and shouldn't fly in paternity fraud.  Someone who commits paternity fraud is just as guilty as someone committing any other kind of fraud and should be held equally accountable.  Similarly the victim is just as victimized as with any other type of fraud and just as deserving to get back the money they were defrauded.

They find young and vulnerable women needing support.

Then they tell them all of their problems are the fault of men, and that all systems to address their issues are designed by men to silence them (when, in reality, society amplifies female suffering and female suffering is political capital for social campaigns$.

Then they tell them that their physical (and psychological/emotional) abuse is ok because they could never actually harm men - and if they do it is ok because they are “punching up.”

“Your problems aren't your fault. I can show you the enemy. It is time to fight the enemy. Anyone who disagrees was compromised by the enemy.”

She was a coward who would not stand toe-to-toe with this guy when she attacked him. She scooted away and pretended that it was an accident - until confronted about it. Then, rather then accept accountability for her actions, she took the coward's way out.

She fucked up a golden life of a pre-law degree at a prestigious school. She only understood at the very end the mistake she made. It didn't start with the coffee; it started when she accepted that she could act as a vigilante and get away with it. That poison came from feminism, and no doubt from parents that ensured she was never accountable. Even now, they sue Stanford for promoting due process and defending their students from attack. They refuse even now to accept that their daughter is responsible for her actions.

In the end, she committed a violent crime, lied about it, and was unrepentant. She showed total disregard for due process.

It's arguably better to document when someone attacks you and then collect lots of money in court. Hitting back is less effective than suing back.

My parents explained that I should respond only in kind.  That is, if the punches didn't hurt - don't hurt the person punching.  And I should get away from them.

Of course, if the punches did hurt, then I should defend myself - but never with more force than was being dished out.  That seemed fair.  It didn't matter who was hitting me, if they were small and ineffectual, I could ignore them and walk away.  And that tended to piss them off a lot!!  If they were my size or bigger, or truly aiming to do harm, I could stop the attack with a measured response.  And then get away.

These arguments can also be used to show that ACTUAL feminism is not following the dictionary definition of equality:

So what you're saying is that you, a commenter using a username on an internet forum are the true feminist, and the feminists actually responsible for changing the laws, writing the academic theory, teaching the courses, influencing the public policies, and the massive, well-funded feminist organizations with thousands and thousands of members all of whom call themselves feminists... they are not ""real feminists"".

That's not just ""no true Scotsman"". That's delusional self deception. Listen, if you want to call yourself a feminist, I don't care. I've been investigating feminism for more than 9 years now, and people like you used to piss me off, because to my mind all you were doing was providing cover and ballast for the powerful political and academic feminists you claim are just jerks. And believe me, they ARE jerks. If you knew half of what I know about the things they've done under the banner of feminism, maybe you'd stop calling yourself one. But I want you to know. You don't matter. 

You're not the director of the Feminist Majority Foundation and editor of Ms. Magazine, Katherine Spillar, who said of domestic violence: ""Well, that's just a clean-up word for wife-beating,"" and went on to add that regarding male victims of dating violence, ""we know it's not girls beating up boys, it's boys beating up girls.""

You're not Jan Reimer, former mayor of Edmonton and long-time head of Alberta's Network of Women's Shelters, who just a few years ago refused to appear on a TV program discussing male victims of domestic violence, because for her to even show up and discuss it would lend legitimacy to the idea that they exist.

You're not Mary P Koss, who describes male victims of female rapists in her academic papers as being not rape victims because they were ""ambivalent about their sexual desires"" (if you don't know what that means, it's that they actually wanted it), and then went on to define them out of the definition of rape in the CDC's research because it's inappropriate to consider what happened to them rape. You're not the National Organization for Women, and its associated legal foundations, who lobbied to replace the gender neutral federal Family Violence Prevention and Services Act of 1984 with the obscenely gendered Violence Against Women Act of 1994. The passing of that law cut male victims out of support services and legal assistance in more than 60 passages, just because they were male. You're not the Florida chapter of the NOW, who successfully lobbied to have Governor Rick Scott veto not one, but two alimony reform bills in the last ten years, bills that had passed both houses with overwhelming bipartisan support, and were supported by more than 70% of the electorate.

You're not the feminist group in Maryland who convinced every female member of the House on both sides of the aisle to walk off the floor when a shared parenting bill came up for a vote, meaning the quorum could not be met and the bill died then and there.

You're not the feminists in Canada agitating to remove sexual assault from the normal criminal courts, into quasi-criminal courts of equity where the burden of proof would be lowered, the defendant could be compelled to testify, discovery would go both ways, and defendants would not be entitled to a public defender.

You're not Professor Elizabeth Sheehy, who wrote a book advocating that women not only have the right to murder their husbands without fear of prosecution if they make a claim of abuse, but that they have the moral responsibility to murder their husbands. You're not the feminist legal scholars and advocates who successfully changed rape laws such that a woman's history of making multiple false allegations of rape can be excluded from evidence at trial because it's ""part of her sexual history.""

You're not the feminists who splattered the media with the false claim that putting your penis in a passed-out woman's mouth is ""not a crime"" in Oklahoma, because the prosecutor was incompetent and charged the defendant under an inappropriate statute (forcible sodomy) and the higher court refused to expand the definition of that statute beyond its intended scope when there was already a perfectly good one (sexual battery) already there. You're not the idiot feminists lying to the public and potentially putting women in Oklahoma at risk by telling potential offenders there's a ""legal"" way to rape them.

And you're none of the hundreds or thousands of feminist scholars, writers, thinkers, researchers, teachers and philosophers who constructed and propagate the body of bunkum theories upon which all of these atrocities are based.

Don't express an opinion, merely let them go further and further towards whatever the underlying mentality is. You might also ask if she agrees with the song's sentiments.

2. You can break up with her in several ways:

A. By becoming unattractive to her so that she leaves you and thinks she is doing the break up. I don't recommend doing that here because it is a closed situation, you can't leave and she might well get together with other girls to bully you.

B. By behaving ultra red-pill, another learning game. Here what you need to do is separate inner game from outer game. The inner game in this situation requires the ability to float above things without getting drawn in to anything emotionally. Red pillers sometimes refer to this as ""amused mastery"". It is an invaluable skill in all walks of life. The outer game, which is all most people ever think about, is how you actually handle the situation.

Always document any harassment or abuse, especially in email or writing. The best way to respond to patronizing harassment is to simply ask them to explain it.

If you're the only one working 60 hours a week and everyone else is doing 40-45, yeah, that isn't right and needs to be addressed. Instead of complaining about it on Reddit and just switching jobs you need to set boundaries at your work and tell them you're not comfortable working that much and that you'd rather keep your hours lower.

It's a social construction maneuver induced by global corporations to increase hyper-consumerism. think about it. all marketing companies know that women are more fickle, emotional and frivolous in general, they spend much more on products than a man who in general is more practical and logical in his choice. their goal is to transfer as much money as possible into the hands of women who are more likely to spend it on products than men. they do this in multiple ways:

1. By encouraging high standards for women, they make it more likely that they will be single, which means that the costs of the house are not shared but are all at her expense.
2. by encouraging divorces that benefit women economically. between alimony, movable and immovable property etc. the more resources a woman has the more she will spend.
3. increasing the variety and diversity of commercial advertisements.
4. effeminating more and more men to make them women 2.0 as regards their predisposition to spend money on nonsense.
5. through planned obsolescence. in which especially textile and electronic products are specially made fragile so that there is a need to buy them again and again and again ...
6. By encouraging ""simp"" behavior in men, you are encouraging them to spend money. plain and simple. that's all companies want.
7. increasing the ease with which money can be spent through debit cards etc.
8. By encouraging women to work, they make them more independent which means higher standards, more spending on products, and more production for companies.

iyh6mqu,t1_iyh10v6,"And prestige, and this is where it's becoming ridiculous.",t3_z9encg
iyhb9e4,t1_iyh10v6,"This isn't something she chooses. Child support cannot be agreed upon nor negotiated. It's calculated by the state and dads have to pay lest your wages be garnished.

Moms can opt to not collect it but they are always owed it. That means even after years of not collecting they can change their minds and collect the full amount that hadn't been collected.",t3_z9encg
iygod5s,t1_iygl69s,"What's better about him?

His public fall outs, moving to another state without his kids or that he wants his kids in a school that only teaches singing and clapping?",t3_z9encg
iygsg8b,t1_iygho07,"yeah but its about the principle bro, how come a man has to pay child support to a woman who has $1.4 billion dollars more than him",t3_z9encg
iyhb4u4,t1_iyh899b,Stop😂,t3_z9encg
iyh4d1j,t1_iyh425m,"fr, why involve the govt. in your personal relationships and i'd get a good prenup if i was going to marry as well",t3_z9encg
iyhazl5,t1_iyhaqf9,yeah cuz a woman with 1.8 billion dollars needs support financially,t3_z9encg
iygw0aw,t1_iygvowc,"its not about how much money ye has its about what the principle around this situation is and how fucked up it is, a man is being forced to pay child support to a woman with $1.4 billion dollars more than him it doesn't matter if u like ye or hate him, follow his opinions or don't this situation is messed up lol",t3_z9encg
iyh4w4q,t1_iyh3e0w,"its not about kanye its about a man being forced to pay money to a woman who has more than he does by a lot, its about the principle and how this is wrong idgaf if u hate kanye this is an injustice and a lot of other men face it",t3_z9encg
iyh5ag0,t1_iyh39mw,No: main reason being Kim's sextape.,t3_z9encg
iygsnav,t1_iygsjh1,50000 per child per month. But he'll have to pay at this rate for like 16 years or so,t3_z9encg
iygp31v,t1_iygod5s,Everything,t3_z9encg
iyh0lav,t1_iygsg8b,Does she have to give him anything? I thought 50/50 custody meant a 50/50 support cheque?,t3_z9encg
iyh86e4,t1_iygsg8b,Apparently she also has to pay him the same amount in child support back,t3_z9encg
iyh5ngl,t1_iygsg8b,"Because wealthy or not, he has children and should pay to support them? Especially since it looks like Kim has majority custody.",t3_z9encg
iyhc9o5,t1_iyhazl5,"Again, it's not for her, it's for the children. They're the children of both the father and the mother, so the financial responsibilities are shared.",t3_z9encg
iyh20bh,t1_iygw0aw,"I'm not even opposed to him paying for half of the kid's expenses, but what kid spends 50k a month?",t3_z9encg
iyh2xoe,t1_iygw0aw,"They had prenup for sure, and if you are still crying about the change he has to share with his ex-wife for children's upbringing, you are seriously dumb. 

I don't want men rights to be associated with lunatics such is Kanye, I like the dude for his music, but you are not getting anywhere if you are trying to make him the face of men rights.",t3_z9encg
iyh5qrq,t1_iyh4w4q,"How much money Kim Kardashian has doesn't matter. If you're the father of kids you don't see, you have to provide for their support. Why should Kanye be any different?",t3_z9encg
iyh5bcn,t1_iyh5ag0,Ah yeah that too.,t3_z9encg
iygto14,t1_iygsnav,"Got me there I guess, gotta love the modern day justice system",t3_z9encg
iygplhm,t1_iygp31v,"So you think moving cross country and abandoning his kids is fine? 

You sure have an interesting view on what makes a good parent, that's for sure.",t3_z9encg
iyh28q1,t1_iyh0lav,\*Laughs in Title IV-D,t3_z9encg
iyh62mh,t1_iyh5ngl,That doesn't make any sense. How exactly does that money help support the children when their mother is a billionaire?,t3_z9encg
iyh2h1m,t1_iyh20bh,It's not about the kid.  Hasn't been since the 80's.,t3_z9encg
iyh2z9m,t1_iyh20bh,The type of kid that has billionaires as parents,t3_z9encg
iyh3qlr,t1_iyh2xoe,"i'm not making him “the face of mens rights” im showing an injustice that's happening where a man is being forced to pay money no matter how small of a difference it makes to him losing that money to a woman who has $1.4 billion dollars more than him, im just showing if this is happening to kanye im sure other men are being forced to pay money which they couldn't afford to women who have more money than them under child support, if you can't set aside your personal differences from kanye to see that this is wrong you should grow up. child support is used as support to raise the child and should only be given when its needed and kim clearly doesn't need it",t3_z9encg
iyh6220,t1_iyh5bcn,"Father was the fire, sex tape was the gasoline. My sex tape got me shit.",t3_z9encg
iyh6b5f,t1_iygto14,It's not modern and it's not justice. It's family court and it's stacked against males HEAVILY.,t3_z9encg
iygpua6,t1_iygplhm,Who filed for divorce l?,t3_z9encg
iygwrsl,t1_iygplhm,A harlot from a degenerate family is no fit parent either.,t3_z9encg
iyh69t3,t1_iyh62mh,He is also rich. They have both raised those kids to be accustomed to a certain standard of living- whether you agree with it or not. That takes money to keep up. Why should she have to foot the bill solo for their children?,t3_z9encg
iyh5my1,t1_iyh3qlr,"Dude was richer than Kim months ago, his net worth was estimated much higher than before his meltdown and more than 2 billions at least.

Also, those children are not Kim's only, but his as well, this is barely a symbolic contribution in terms of money he has to give, and will easily give more, he is a father ffs and that money is 2 out of many real estate properties he has.

Yes you are making him the face of the men rights, if someone comes to this subreddit and sees people defending Ye after his abusive behavior, they will give up easily on this subreddit to inform themselves. 

I live in a country were divorced husband has to give half of his salary for allimony, yet you are crying about nutcases like this guy.

You have nothing in common with a billionaire, give up on him as an example of anything.",t3_z9encg
iygqcra,t1_iygpua6,"Oh this is great!

Kim Kardashian filed for divorce AFTER Kanye West moved to another state and did not even come and visit the kids and her for 2 years! 

But sure he is a good parent from thousands of miles away.",t3_z9encg
iygx8k6,t1_iygwrsl,"But a diagnosed mentally sick person, who refuses his meds and abandoned his kids is? Yeah cool cool.",t3_z9encg
iygqhv9,t1_iygqcra,people travel for work.,t3_z9encg
iygqjt8,t1_iygqcra,honestly dont know why he married her anyways dude wasn't thinking at all,t3_z9encg
iygxc40,t1_iygx8k6,"Neither one of them are good parents frankly.  They'd be better off being put up for adoption.

It won't happen, but that now-broken household is a minefield of emotional and psychological problems.

They should have never been together or married.",t3_z9encg
iygqq84,t1_iygqhv9,"He did not travel, he moved to live in another state. He spend all the pandemic in another state without is kids.

Just stop, you obviously just saw „Kim Kardashian“ and thought the man must be a better parent, it's Kim Kardashian 🤷🏻‍♀️.",t3_z9encg
iygr0kq,t1_iygqjt8,"Honestly you don't have to know.

But just to put this in your head….he chased her for years, even when she was married to someone else.",t3_z9encg
iygxmd5,t1_iygxc40,"You can say about the Kardashian what you want, but they are good mothers who alway facilitate the relationships between their kids and the fathers. 

And who are you, that you think you have a place to judge who should and who shouldn't be married, have kids or be put up for adoption?",t3_z9encg
iygr8mq,t1_iygqq84,nah i just understand she would win anyways so why would he try,t3_z9encg
iygy4lo,t1_iygxmd5,"There's a number of factors one should evaluate when looking into marriage and/or dating:  both parties weren't ever going to mesh well enough.

West is a strange, sad man who--look, I'm agreeing with you!--shouldn't be doing anything other than working on his mental health.  I find the whole concept of calling yourself a nickname or whatever to have a ""brand"" to be odd and childish.  

I don't have much to say about the K clan because I hold the concept of ""getting rich and famous off of sex tapes"" with disdain.  They come off as disingenuous and fake, self-absorbed and arrogant.

I'm not getting into personal attacks.  All I will say is if all parties involved are lucky, these children won't be psychologically damaged by these broken people and will escape the hellhole of their lives as they are now.",t3_z9encg
iyh2fp8,t1_iygxmd5,"OK.  I thought your comments defending EVERY post had to do with the good ol' In-Group Bias or something.

You jumped the shark on this one. Like Fonzie with leather.  


>And who are you, that you think you have a place to judge who should and who shouldn't be married, have kids or be put up for adoption?

That's the problem of today.  A certain group wants no agency, no accountability, no consequences, no standards.  The problems we're facing socially come from a lack of these.",t3_z9encg
iygu2v2,t1_iygr8mq,Would he try what? She wanted to share custody 50/50 but he leaves the kids 80% of the time with her…..,t3_z9encg
iygzk4r,t1_iygy4lo,"All people are broken people….that doesn't make them unfit to marry or have kids. When you abandon your spouse and kids though, that's another story. 

The kids are obviously not in danger and well taken care off, so I would say they are better off then a lot of kids.

And I doubt that Kim ever made money off the sex tape, let alone the rest of her family.",t3_z9encg
iyh2zx5,t1_iyh2fp8,Huh? You you think there should be some „counsel“ or so that decides who is allowed to get married or have kids…..that sounds very much Germany 1940s.,t3_z9encg
iyh3o1c,t1_iygzk4r,"Wasn't the sex tape how her career started?

Harlotry/thottotry whatever you want to call it tends to cause self esteem and psychological issues in children because frankly it's impossible to respect a parent who allows that kind of lifestyle to happen to themselves.

Moreover, it's been proven children do best with both parents around.  Kim had to know something was seriously wrong with The Drama King before they ever got together.

Vetting is exceptionally imperative with children around and both parties failed in this instance.

May both get the therapy they need, never have anything to do with each other again, and grow/improve from this situation.",t3_z9encg
