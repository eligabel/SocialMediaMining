iyggyg9,t3_z9cjr9,"From a mental perspective, there is a ""good mind"" so to speak, that tells you right from wrong, When you are faced with temptation, your good mind will tell you ""hey stop, this is wrong."" Like right before you steal something. But it's your God given free will to listen or not. Or even when something tells you to give a homeless person a dollar, or smile at a stranger. That good mind, or good spirit, I believe, lives in all things. One may believe, that is God. From a spiritual perspective, I believe that our souls are all apart of the same essence of creation, and therefore that spiritual connection can be seen as God. The energy of life itself. I think it is good to believe in something greater than yourself, something beyond us, that wills creation to grow. So long as we don't push our beliefs on others, or judge others for theirs. I think every person is a piece of creation, and therefore holds a piece of understanding creation. From a scientific perspective, all things are vibration, and so I do believe that the universe was spoken into existence. Whether that be by the grand creator himself or even a smaller creator, who may also have been created. I believe in the wise spirit that is unconditional love, and I believe love rings through the universe forever and ever. As a person who could never understand how everyone around me believed in God for years, I have finally found my own understanding, and I think that that is what matters. Your relationship with the Spirit is between you and it, and nobody else. I believe in God in my own way. (: I see, what I perceive to be God, in little things everywhere. Whether it be the songbird in the morning, the leaves dancing in the wind, a sudden epiphany after many tears, children's laughter, the sweet sound of guitar strings, wondrous clouds in the sky, a hug from a loved one. I suppose a grateful heart sees beauty in things, and gives that glory to whatever made these beautiful things possible. I see God in all the beautiful idiosyncrasies of life. I see God in every person and everything. There were times in my life when I was alone, and many times I scoffed at God, and denied God, but in retrospect, I have come to realize God was always by my side. The Lord is my rock and always will be! <3",t3_z9cjr9,"From a mental perspective, there is a ""good mind"" so to speak, that tells you right from wrong, When you are faced with temptation, your good mind will tell you ""hey stop, this is wrong.""

iyggw60,t1_iygb5n7,"Tremors is a legitimately well-made movie. The script is studied in some film classes, there's no fat on the script and it has a lot of great foreshadowing that people don't realize.

Like the very beginning with Fred Ward slithering out of the bed of his truck zipped inside a sleeping bag because Kevin Bacon was shaking the truck. It foreshadows the monster, the sleeping bag made him resemble and move like a graboid and was moving because of vibrations from Kevin Bacon shaking the truck. Also if you pay attention to the background, they're at the same location that the graboid accidently falls off of at the end to it's death. That scene is also why Val later says ""It just hit me y'know, stampede""

iygoum9,t1_iygjbzt,"That the story of the book Emma's character is writing is clearly well thought out. The movie implies there are three protagonists to the book: The kid, the woman and Harold Crick. The three of them start at a sort of ""new beginnings"" chapters of their lives, the kid with the bike, the woman finally finding a job and Harold finding love.

So it follows that these changes to their lives that start as joyous moments, will inevitably lead to tragedy. The gifted bike, the woman taking that job and, well, Harold changing his clockwork-like schedule, will lead to Harold dying and will probably end up affecting the lives of the other two characters negatively since the interview with the writer seen on TV mentions she only writes tragedies.

And once you add that Harold's death is causing Emma a hard time (because it's gotta be significant) and that him not dying makes the ending bad to the point even Harold agrees, you can see the outline of what the book is about.

Harold's death has to negatively affect the other two because the point is that death is inevitable and cruel. It's the fact that Harold is starting to enjoy his life that his sudden death, and domino effect on the life of the other two would make you close the book and think ""Damn"", and leave you wondering about everything you truly want to do and aren't doing because you're letting life happen to you. But if Harold saves the kid AND survives and there's no negative outcome to all this build up, just a nice little happy ending, the book's narrative sort of falls flat. The message it was driving towards is lost.

There was no need for ""Death and Taxes"" to make sense because the overarching narrative of the book is not necessary for the movie. And yet they took the time to shape a silhouette.

Edit: This is possible my favorite quote of all time:

""Harold: Who in their right mind in a choice between pancakes and living chooses pancakes?!

Dustin Hoffman: Harold, if you pause to think, you'd realize that the answer is inextricably contingent upon the type of life being led... and, of course, the quality of the pancakes""

2b) Think of credit as ""anti-investments"", where interest works against you. Make a short-term plan to eliminate as much of your debts as possible. Consider the psychology of the ""Small win"" and take out a small balance first to hit those good brain chemicals.  
3) Establish a savings fund and keep it loaded for when life hits you. You are less likely to fall back onto credit sources if you have a rainy day fund. Change your mindset that this account is not accessible, you must truly be in a real emergency to access it.   
4) This is more philosophical, but get mad at yourself. There is unlimited potential and opportunity in the world - what are you doing that is causing you to be in poverty? Honestly listen to yourself justify your victimhood, then refuse to remain the victim. You are where you are because of a series of decisions that added up to equal today. Get really frustrated with the status quo and vow to change things. Set your goal post and with every decision ask yourself ""Does this keep me on track for my financial goal, or does this take me off course?""  
5) Convince yourself that you don't ""deserve nice things"". Sure in reality we all deserve nice things, but if you really embrace the idea that owning things second hand, buying used, or being generally thrifty is fine or even a rewarding hobby, you can save so much on things.  
6) If you have a spouse or very close friend, consider asking them to be your ""accountability partner"" (though a spouse needs to embrace all of this with you or it plainly won't work well and will add stress to your relationship...) with regular ""check-ins"". Think something akin to support groups, because in reality that's what this thing is, you are trying to break a series of habits that arguably are negatively impacting you.  
7) As the previous steps start to come together, establish a long-term emergency fund - think layoff, another pandemic, etc. Once that fund is straight, open a Roth IRA (some age assumptions on my end, I assume you are 20s-30s FD), and do your best to max it out.

Cut all unnecessary expenses immediately. You don't need streaming services, gym membership, random subscriptions, etc. Get food from the grocery store and cook meals for yourself rather than fast food. Use the internet and find economical meals to cook. Find a second job that is close to home for extra income if you need it. Serving/bussing tables for cash is a good option. Shop at stores with better prices. Quit drinking and smoking, they are really expensive. Get a library card and utilize your local library. Earn more, spend less. 

Each paycheck, take $250 or an amount you are comfortable with, transfer it to a savings account, and leave it alone. Pay yourself first. Don't skip this step.

Set a goal for the amount you want saved in that account for every 2,4,6,8, and 12 months. Commit to those goals. 

Pay off high interest debt or balances with recurring fees such as credit card balances. That interest or those fees need to be going in your pocket, not to a company. Set a goal for when you want the balance paid off by. 

This is not a fun or glamorous lifestyle, but that is not what's important. It's called living low to the ground and tightening your belt for a while. If you stick by this, you will build up a formidable savings account by the time you are 30.

Don't over spend on internet, if you live by yourself there's no reason to have 100GB/s speeds, you'll never notice a difference between that and 50mb/s speeds.

Get rid of the subscription services you've forgotten to use. There's plenty of free entertainment options.

Control the addictions, kick them if you can. Stop wasting money getting high. Shit adds up fast. If your struggling to keep the water or electric on because you blew your whole paycheck on weed, coke, vapes, cigs, or booze; you have a problem and need help.

Then control your spending. First I'd say it quit the ""keeping up with the joneses"" ie if your phone works there's no reason to upgrade it every year or two, keep it until it literally disintegrates. This applies to everything, phones, clothing, cars, etc.

Don't over spend on internet, if you live by yourself there's no reason to have 100GB/s speeds, you'll never notice a difference between that and 50mb/s speeds. 

Quit the Uber eats and Doordash orders, get your lazy ass to get your own damn food and save the $30 delivery fees. On food: lean to cook, and food prep, instead of spending $15-20 per meal eating out or on fast food, learn the budget meals that come out to like $2/plate. 

Get rid of the subscription services you've forgotten to use. There's plenty of free entertainment options.

Control the addictions, kick them if you can. Stop wasting money getting high. Shit adds up fast. If your struggling to keep the water or electric on because you blew your whole paycheck on weed, coke, vapes, cigs, or booze; you have a problem and need help.

Really look at where you live and if you really need to be there. Again if you're by yourself do you really need a 2 bedroom apartment or can you find a cheaper smaller place? Or if you have the extra space get a roommate even if it is some weird rando and split costs.",,,

iygu48y,t1_iygbfp9,"It varies widely though. In the Navy it could be a cushy office life as an IT or YN, or you can be literally swimming in shit as HT. Ratings can make all the difference, in other military branches I guess that's what specialist qualifications are for? Be aware of how you test out and what you qualify for in general and ask around more than letting some recruiter push you into something specifically for quotas.

Of course it's still not for everyone. Depends on what you're able/willing to put up with, and whether you make rate given the politics and general conditions of the particular command you're assigned to. Tenure is a thing no matter what (wages do increase over the years even if you don't advance somehow), and in general it's too easy to get bumped down over stupid things than always getting good evaluation scores to advance upwards. And yes there are higher ups that will play favorites while also setting up others for failure with scheduling and other assignments that are by no means reasonable short of being some super-soldier. So you have to watch out for that too.

The only shame is the enlisted-to-officer program cuts off at a relatively young age. I suppose there are reasons for that, but such opens up a lot of options for the nicer (mostly administrative) jobs.

An alternate career path when the officer program isn't available is a lateral one. That is to GS contractors. It's not officially promoted, so some overlook it. But such depends on getting certain technical skills or qualifications that are even narrower than scope than ratings or specialist classes themselves. (Usually knowing specific pieces of equipment that have maintenance contracted out, databases or other record management, or skills with tight requirements like NDT and welding.) I just wanted the hell away from Norfolk when I got out of the Navy, otherwise that could have led to a good paying GS job looking back at things.

It really is ""YMMV"" type of thing. Don't get in to screw off, you should at least be on the ball enough to at least get out with an honorable discharge if you go that route.",t3_z9dniy,"It varies widely though.

My family is republican/conservative. 
I believed myself to be conservative my entire life. 
I believe in freedom to bear arms, and that typical right wing stuff. But I also think we shouldn't ban abortions for emergency's.  Rape/danger to mom/etc. 

But I also believe we should be putting more money into the education system and welfare programs. I believe every kid deserves a fair and fighting chance which makes me want to open free private schools, orphanages, big sibling type of organizations, and just charities to help those in need. 
I think Americans should be taxed a lot less. But I also think that our taxes are being wasted. The American people deserve those basics. Especially our veterans. 

I don't believe in the open border, student loan forgiveness and so on.  But I think we should ease our immigration requirements to give them a fair chance while also increasing security at the border. Not from people, but DANGEROUS drugs and anything that endangers people. 
There's a ton more. But family calls me a liberal, but I don't think my policies are liberal. I just think that American people matter more and we should stop allowing those companies to screw the small guy over.",t3_z9e390,"Reddit. Where would I fall in line politically?

iygkdpu,t3_z9e4n8,"I was 17, she was 16.  It was a first serious relationship for both of us.  We were good for a while, but really we had no business being together.  We fought a lot, even with so little to fight about.  We were both reactionary young people rebeling against who knows what.  

We weren't as careful as we should have been, obviously.  We had been together for about a year.  At first it sort of brought us closer together.  We thought it might work.  

I was a senior and she was a junior.  I was already working and starting to skip school a lot.  My grades were good, but I didn't want to be there.  She was making plans for college, I was falling deeper into a hole.  School was bad, home was bad, relationship was bad.  I didn't use drugs or drink yet, but all the things that would send me down that path were falling into place.  I was depressed, I felt trapped in where I was, and most days I thought very seriously about suicide.  

I tried to be what I thought a partner should be, but I had no clue.  I grew up in a single parent household, my father having committed suicide when I was very young.  My mother had remarried for just long enough to pop out another kid.  I spent a lot of time alone and raising that kid, my half-sister.  I saw what bouncing back and forth between two parents was doing to her.  There wasn't any abuse or anything super awful, but it affected her.  

At this point I've basically dropped out of school.  I've gotten kicked out of my house because I wasn't planning on going to college.  The baby is due anyday and all we do is fight.  We break up basically everytime we see eachother.  Out of guilt I end up getting back together with her and convince myself we can make it work.  

Shortly before she's due we have a full on argument/break up.  This is a time before cell phones so we fight over the landline.  She calls at all hours pretending to be other people.  She accuses me of all sorts of things and I call her names.  

When she goes into labor she doesn't even tell me.  I find out the next day.  

We are broken up, but trying to figure out a way to co-parent.  Then she finds out I'm moving on.  She flips out and comes to the place I was living and physically attacks me.  I have to restrain her and I put her into her car, while threatening to call the cops.  

We go to court for a restraining order.  It's granted, but temporary.  It's at this point I start to realize this isn't going to work at all.  I'm in no place to raise a child, financially or mentally. 

Over time it just stopped being a thing.  We would see eachother once a week.  Then once a month, then holidays, then never.  My kid was 2 when I last saw him.  

That was over 20 years ago.  

My 20s were filled with guilt and shame.  I sometimes was able to convince myself that what happened was best for everyone.  I believed it some days.  Other days I thought I was a worthless piece of shit.  That's when the drinking and the drugs started being a thing.  I was in a good relationship, but I fucked it up.  Then I stayed single out of guilt.  I didn't feel like I deserved to be happy.  My purpose was to keep working to earn money for child support.  My work became my life.  

I didn't have a great job, but I lived alright.  No luxuries, but there was money for alcohol and cigarettes.  I came very close to killing myself a few times.  Some by accident, some intentional.  

Then something odd happened.  I ran into one of her friends.  I inquired how she was doing and they said very well.  That she had settled down with a man and had a few more kids.  That she enjoyed being a mother.  

It didn't make the guilt go away, but it did start to ease up.  I ended up getting into a decent relationship for a few years and learned more about myself and being a good partner.  Over time I became a relatively normal person with a relatively normal life.  

She and I spoke once.  Years later.  She held no hard feelings and seemed happy.  I never saw my son, but I still believe that was probably for the best.  

I firmly believe that if I had stayed in that relationship I would have ended up killing myself.  Does that justify my decision?  I can't say.  I do believe that I would have been a bad parent, especially back then.  Again, does that justify anything?  I really don't know.  

So how I justify it is that I think the decision I made lead to the least amount of suffering for my son.",t3_z9e4n8,"I was 17, she was 16.  It was a first serious relationship for both of us.

Then something odd happened.  I ran into one of her friends.  I inquired how she was doing and they said very well.  That she had settled down with a man and had a few more kids.  That she enjoyed being a mother.  

It didn't make the guilt go away, but it did start to ease up.  I ended up getting into a decent relationship for a few years and learned more about myself and being a good partner.  Over time I became a relatively normal person with a relatively normal life.  

She and I spoke once.  Years later.  She held no hard feelings and seemed happy.  I never saw my son, but I still believe that was probably for the best.  

I firmly believe that if I had stayed in that relationship I would have ended up killing myself.  Does that justify my decision?  I can't say.  I do believe that I would have been a bad parent, especially back then.  Again, does that justify anything?  I really don't know.  

So how I justify it is that I think the decision I made lead to the least amount of suffering for my son.",,,

iyghzyx,t3_z9e74o,"Here are some options that might help, this is what i do at least.

1. Stay up later or wake up earlier. I'm a fan of staying up later than my wife and kids so i can get an extra 2-3 hours of silence / me time. If it's early morning / early afternoon and I find myself frustrated, or just worn out from people I go to the gym alone. Even if its just for some cardio / treadmill or whatever. The time alone is helpful for me to get my emotions in check. If its after work and I'm drained, sometimes i just sit in the car for an extra 10 mins before i walk into the home. 

2. Setting aside dedicated scheduled time for a hobby. Whether its gym routine, sports nights, video games on Thursday nights etc… Have some time dedicated to an activity thats for you and make sure she knows its important to you. Just make sure they're on board with it and set some expectations with her beforehand. Might make your life a little easier if you surprise her with something before if she doesn't really like the hobby you have. Dinner for her, clean the house before, run the bath for her, just something extra so she knows you care. (Always helped me when I raided weekly in WoW, she wasn't a fan)

3. This one can be a little tough, at least it was for me. Just like you need your alone time for you to function. Sometimes people need that 1 on 1 time talking for them to function. Take a deep breath, put the phone down, turn the TV off, sit up, face her, have eye contact, give her your full attention, and let her talk away. It's easy to get wrapped into our own world of what you need. Maybe how you feel after you have your alone time, is how she feels after she has her 1 on 1 conversations with you. It turns the process less of, please stop talking to so i can just have silence, and more into an act of service of she needs to have this to rebalance. (Or i could be totally wrong, like I said these are some things that have helped in my relationship with my wife, and could be totally wrong for you.)

4. I know a million people have said communicate. But there has to be some form of commutation that you need alone time. But express this when you're having the deep conversations about your relationship or those deep conversations about how you function or how your mind works. I've said it a million times to my wife that working with people drains me. I'm not extroverted, talking to and interacting with people does not energize me, my social gas tank is finite and talking to people burns up the gas pretty quick. I need alone time to fill that tank back up. Express how the alone time recalibrates your mood/emotions/whatever it does for you. My point is, share this not when you need alone time, but when you're having those serious conversations. That way when you ask for alone time she understands why you need alone time and is more likely to remember those needs and support you. Just remember to give her a big ol' smooch after your alone time and thank her for letting you get that time. Show appreciation when it happens.

This was a lot longer of a comment that I intended, hope some of this is useful for you. These are things that I've done that have really helped me with your question, its also a question I've asked to my buddies before too.

- I have told my partner that sometimes I need decompression time. For how long? It varies. Some days are more tiring that others.
I'll usually be up front about it after saying our ""hellos"" and kisses and then go to my corner.


- If I am asked ""do you want to talk about it"" I will simply say I will try after I decompress and process.
That way she can feel that I am not outright ""pushing her away.""


- If boundaries continue to be pushed and space is not given, I will push back and make it clear that this is not helping and space is needed.


- If that doesn't work, then a serious conversation needs to be had regarding the state of the relationship and what each person needs.


- If that doesn't work, boundaries are continued to be pushed, and your need for space are still being ignored, then I suggest counseling. At this point there is clearly a communication disconnect and/or bigger issue at play.


- Worse case scenario is that one is not compatible with the person in question. No shame or fault there. One can be 70 or even 80% compatible with their partner and truly love them with all their heart. But if a major deal breaker quality is hit, the whole relationship can be torpedo'd. And that deal breaker doesn't have to be an objectively ""big"" thing. Just a ""big"" thing to YOU.



In the meantime you can take longer to get home, sit in the car before going into the home, take longer in the bathroom, etc. The usual male tropes.

Edit: Whether you like it or not, a conversation needs to be had. No one is a mind reader and being too passive (or worse, passive aggressive) is going to cause more issues in the long run.

You ARE allowed to push back and ask for space. If you need it for your well being, you need it.

If that is too much of an ask for her, or she ignores it outright, then that itself is a serious issue that needs to be addressed.

Edit2: Another person had this issue awhile back and they said they had to explain it in a way the other could understand.

iyggpis,t1_iygd8g1,"It is not about just about communicating in the moment (in fact it's mostly NOT about the communication in the moment), but rather communicating ahead of time.  Don't wait until you are stressed and craving space to attempt to effectively and calmly explain your need for space; do it ahead of time when you and your partner are both in a calm and loving place conducive to active listening.

My wife and I have for years used stoplight terms as code words for this.  When one of us needs time and space for ourselves, we will tell our partner that we are in a “Red” place.  “Red” means a firm “I love you but I am in a stressed out space or very busy/focused on a project where I am politely asking you to not engage with me unless it is very urgent or pressing that you do so.”  “Yellow” means “I love you but I am a bit stressed or otherwise occupied, and would prefer space but can engage if you need me to.”  If we are not declaring ourselves “Yellow” or “Red”, we are presumed to be “Green” (“engage or don't engage as you wish, it's all good” place); so we never actually bother to say “Green” (rather, one of us will just say, “I'm not ‘Red' anymore if you want to talk now” if we said we were ‘Red' earlier).

We talked about this well in advance of use and were able to explain to both our satisfactions then what the terms mean and what they don't mean.  We continue to check in about it when calm too, if one of us has been in a “Red” or “Yellow” space frequently in a given week.  That's the communication that matters most; as when stressed and seeking space we keep the communication necessarily succinct (just saying “I'm Red” suffices).

We probably use these code words a handful of times with each other every week.  Not everyday but not rarely either.  Some weeks more; some weeks less.  Our kids know what they mean too, and use them themselves (with each other and with us).  I think it is important for one's partner and kids to know that it is normal to ask for space and expect that ask to be respected if possible.

1. She is misunderstanding or discounting the importance and sincerity of OP's request for space.
2. She understands OP's request, but perceives his seeking space as pulling away from her in a way that she finds intolerable.
3. OP is not as clear in expressing his need to her as he believes he is.

All three of these scenarios are best responded to with communication in the calm moments before and after (ie by clarifying what the request really is- responding to 1 and 3; and, equally important, what it is not- as in not a rejection of her or without an expectation of resolution- responding to number 2); that builds a foundation for much more succinct communication during the moments of high stress.

Forgetfulness is possible, but in my work doing family therapy; it is certainly not a leading cause for problems with communication amongst partners who are not explicitly identifying it as the cause (especially if it is not notable in other aspects of their functioning).

iygwdxu,t1_iygs9iv,"That's a valid point about having small children.  Between work and parenting little ones, I wouldn't fault either partner for feeling exhausted and being a bit in a daze!

And I don't think one can ever go wrong in saying it's a mix of factors.  Never met any person, couple, or family that functions the exact same way nor with cleanly packaged experiences sealed from their environment and the pre-existing and coexisting experiences of all involved.  Nor would I want to!  How boring would that be?!

But I, for whatever it's worth as an internet stranger, have some doubts about some of the assumptions that OP made in his answer.  Good communication ahead of a known stressor actually can reduce the energy demand overall and increase the likelihood that important things are remembered and accounted for.

If you live in a house with a basement that floods every time it rains, the time to patch the walls is not when it's raining.  And the energy and time spent patching the walls before a storm is a heck of a lot less than dealing with a flooded basement.  

When someone says they don't have the time or energy to get communication right, it may be that are assuming the time and energy needed for communication before a crisis moment (patching the walls) is the same as they experience during the crisis moment (cleaning up the flooded basement).  Prep work is not extra work but is, in fact, removing excess work down the road.  It is not work that has to be repeated during a crisis, but rather contains the crisis within easier to manage (and easier to remember) boundaries and concepts.

iygdsg6,t3_z9e7yz,"Phase 4 was weak even marvel know that.

They had issue after issue with phase 4 and they couldn't find a way to make things work.

They've also clearly wanted to subvert expectations by doing the opposite to what we expected which I don't think has worked great for most projects. For example She-Hulk they tried to do a lot whilst breaking the fourth wall which ended up giving us a really underwhelming ending, they tried to joke about it but all they did was really hurt the show when it came to the viewers watching experience. 

I mean whether you liked or disliked She-Hulk you've got to admit the ending felt weird and really forced for a laugh. 

Then you have projects like Ms Marvel which looked like it could've been enjoyable but it had the same issue most shows about teenagers have… it had middle aged people writing dialogue for teenagers which never works. It would've been a good show had they just had better dialogue that didn't come across as cringey.

Thor was by far the biggest disappointment. I loved Ragnarok and after Infinity War I thought we would see Thor in a state of just pure rage. In Endgame they kinda undermined it but they still showed us Thor was prepared to sacrifice himself to fix the mistake he thinks he made and then we end up with Love and Thunder. A movie so overly comedic any real suspense had to me undone by a witty one liner that's forced and not that funny. 

Never did I once think I'd watch a movie about a man who lost so much then fight Gorr whilst making jokes about fucking his axe. It was like God Of War if God Of War consisted of a bunch of shitty unity assets and bad dialogue. 

I will give credit where credit is due to phase 4, Spider-Man: No Way Home was a brilliant movie and even when looking past the nostalgia you still have a solid movie about loss, anger and revenge which morphs into a story about morality. 

Then you have Black Panther Wakanda Forever… my god what a movie this was. For a movie that had to cover so many things whilst constantly having issues with filming and having to rewrite the entire movie itself, it was a perfect story about loss and redemption. Ryan didn't just make a movie to make a statement he made a movie that most can relate too which helped captivate an audience of millions if not billions.

Because honestly, there is not really anything you get from it. That people like you? Do you really want to be friends with people who only like you when you aren't yourself but always think about them? 

See, there was this guy in a forum once who could not understand that I don't care that I am quite polarising. I can be bitchy, honestly, if you annoy me. There are some thing that annoy me easily but anyway, I am not a fluffy sunshine then. He said that it can't be that I knew many people don't like me and I still would be like that. You know why? ""Because people want to be liked and people are liked if they are always nice."" Well, no? I don't give a guck if someone who annoys me likes me. I don't give a fuck even if someone I like likes me. I can even like you if you don't like me back and I don't mind. And you know what? It is not like everyone dislikes me. I have friends, people who really like me and they like me because I am who I am. They would not like me if I would be that always nice person that wants to be liked by everyone. Other people would like me then. Where is the sense? Because it would be more people who like me then? Yeah, I prefer friendships of high quality instead of quantity.

No, it is really nice to be friends with people who like you not just **even though** you are who you are but **because** you are who you are. 

And that is the case with everyone. If you stop caring it is just different people who like you because nobody is really liked by everyone, no matter how much they care because there are people like me who are really not into people pleaser and overly nice ones. Well, let's of course assume you don't figure out when you stop caring you are actually a total psychopath, lol. Or without exaggeration, there is a lot in between people pleasers and assholes. See, respect is a big thing for me and if you would always care about what I think about you instead of just being your true self I could not have the respect I would need for really liking you (doesn't automatically mean I would disrespect you and look down on you, it just means high respect on both sides is very important for me). If any I would tolerate you being in my circle. It is indeed so that I often dislike people who are very well liked by everyone else and that I like the people others don't like (I have a thing for the grumpy ones, and I became more than once friends with people I had a lot of arguments with in the beginning - I like people who challenge me). 

I just tell you all that to show you you can not be liked by everyone anyway, no matter how you are. So why would anyone in their right mind if they could decide choose to be liked by those you must be someone else for instead by those who like you for who you are? That would be crazy.

My hair is curly, yet super messy, and I kinda hate it. My parents are constantly begging me to cut it and, while I refuse to do so, I just feel like it looks bad everyday. Yet, I know that if I cut it off, I'll look even worse.

My fashion sense is non existent as I usually go into school with hoodies, jackets, or some anime shirts with some basic blue jeans. I've been told that I look like a homeless person at times.


My tendencies to trust people too quickly as I'm someone who doesn't talk much and is constantly craving for some sort of interaction between different people. Parents never gave me much freedom to really go out and spend time with others, so I'm not used to in person interactions.

My voice. Yes, my voice. I always feel like I sound terrible.

My laugh. It just sounds ugly.

My face. I look like a burnt potato or a chicken nugget.

My body. I just feel unattractive 24/7 and it SUCKS.

My weight / diet: I try to eat healthy every single day, but it's just so hard to stick to it. I end up just eating junk food as it's much easier for me to access that, but I know it's not good for me.

The state of my mental health: with the pressure from my parents, the lack of support I receive from them, the fact that people are consistently stabbing me in the back for no reason, the stress I get from constant assignments and exams, everything comes together to make me feel like I am barely stable. I'm like one mental breakdown away from just taking my frustrations out on someone or something. It feels like I'm in pain everyday.
