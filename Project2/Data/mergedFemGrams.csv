Many studies show correlation between childhood abuse and prostitution. Meaning when women are abused as kids they have a higher chance of becoming sex workers. This doesn't even touch on human trafficking 

Particularly in the areas of prostitution there are many victims of childhood abuse experiences: as a Hamburg study underlines, 83% of the prostitutes surveyed had trauma experiences in early childhood, of which 48% were cases of sexual abuse. There are many studies that show that having experienced abuse during childhood far more often leads to abusive relationships in adulthood.

I am not sure who ‚Äúyou‚Äù is in your sentence. People who work on dismantling cisheteropatriarchal structures by definition work on dismantling issues men face because patriarchy hurts men too. Just like racism hurts White people too. 

look into gender inclusivity vs sexism. gender inclusivity is things like saying ‚Äúdon't hit a lady‚Äù is stupid because it's gendered. But sexism is systemic problems like bathrooms provide toilet paper but not menstrual products because menstruation has been forgotten about even though human has 3 bodily functions. 

hitting people is a stupid example. NO ONE should be physically assaulting anyone. not man or woman. 

Canada doesn't have this problem with child support. anyone can opt out of parenting. That's a US problems so guess what any country can build better systems. 

You are able to apply to scholarships for anyone. Yes go ahead and apply for the ones for women. I don't know what stupidity US is doing with quotas but quota means something else in Canada you can read what employment equity act does. It doesn't hire people based on identity or how they look. It does 2 things: has companies report what they are doing to remove barriers for groups that were historically not accounted for (which was women since they were treated as property and seen as a womb on legs. such that we still for some reason don't have artificial wombs). And has companies report the number of employment equity group employees from voluntary anonymous self disclosure. 

you titanic example is stupid too. that was from a time of long ago. Today people don't rescue passengers based on checking what genital shape they have. 

What is even happening here. Like where did you get these beliefs that people want a traditional man to be protected. Women don't need to be protected, they are able to live on their own. no one needs this protection. If someone is shallow and judged people on looks then that's their problem. Don't interact with women who judge others based on their body. That isn't someone you want to do partnered sexual activity with anyways. 

Again abortion is in fact a necessary right. Not paying child support is possible if your country smartened up. Right now US doesn't even have abortion available. You are tumbling to fascism and all I can say is I'm very sorry. 

Same with domestic violence. Canada has m'en services but even all services are not gendered. Anyone can access them. 

Do you see how everything you explained is systemic problems and not because women exist. you are unhappy with systems but no need to be misogynistic. 

your issues are like what Canada faced in 1990-2000.",t3_z51327,"Are you not aware that systemic problems don't get fixed overnight? there is centuries of sexism that today still have aftermath. From the language people use to the way facilities are designed. 

I am not sure who ‚Äúyou‚Äù is in your sentence. People who work on dismantling cisheteropatriarchal structures by definition work on dismantling issues men face because patriarchy hurts men too. Just like racism hurts White people too. 

look into gender inclusivity vs sexism. gender inclusivity is things like saying ‚Äúdon't hit a lady‚Äù is stupid because it's gendered. But sexism is systemic problems like bathrooms provide toilet paper but not menstrual products because menstruation has been forgotten about even though human has 3 bodily functions. 

hitting people is a stupid example. NO ONE should be physically assaulting anyone. not man or woman. 

Canada doesn't have this problem with child support. anyone can opt out of parenting. That's a US problems so guess what any country can build better systems. 

You are able to apply to scholarships for anyone. Yes go ahead and apply for the ones for women. I don't know what stupidity US is doing with quotas but quota means something else in Canada you can read what employment equity act does. It doesn't hire people based on identity or how they look. It does 2 things: has companies report what they are doing to remove barriers for groups that were historically not accounted for (which was women since they were treated as property and seen as a womb on legs. such that we still for some reason don't have artificial wombs). And has companies report the number of employment equity group employees from voluntary anonymous self disclosure.

You don't face danger regularly. That's not how it works. And when it's gonna occur can't obviously be predicted with certainty.

It is just natural, but frustrating at times. Give them time, space and education and they will grow through the pain of realising their life foundation is a lie. 

The pain of having your world turned upside down and understanding how stupid you were to accept feminism is quite extraordinary and usually self directed, inwards rather than outwards. So, they are noisy and rude but usually harmless. 

The actual end stage is disinterest in women and society as well. Men are, and will, just walk away and leave women and society to fend for themselves.

""Feminism """"""""gave you that choice"""""""", so I determine it's okay... but you should break up with your bf because you want something else"".

""Only date men who are feminist""

""Question him. If he's stunned by your questions & replies with ""you're overthinking this"", dump him"" (major projection & extreme hate/toxicity on her part)

""Patriarchy twisted the basic human need for relationships into the monogamous female submission to men"" (says a stame at home mom who ""married a white man"" and said that like it's a bad thing, then brags about how she ""exercised her choice"" as a ""free independent & retired woman"". What a joke. How strong of you to ""chooce"" to live off of your husband's income. What a hero. A husband whose last name she refused to take after marriage. Not that I care about women taking over the man's name. In my country that doesn't even exist. But she is literally the EPITOME of the ""traditional wife"", without ANY of the ""negatives"").

""I'm a feminist & I'm raising two feminists with a feminist man. It's okay to have relationships as long as everyone is a feminist"" (fucking CULT like extremism beyond words. It's obscene how these lunatics are so blind to their own dogma).

""He should learn to cook & you're not his mom! He shouldn't get used to that! If he develops further ""patriarchal behaviors"", drop him"" (this one came from a self-loathing simp. I don't feel sorry for the dude, he made his own bed pandering to feminists on a man-hating sub).

If he even falls slightly out of line or doesn't answer your deluded questions in exactly the way that feminism‚Ñ¢ approves of, then dump him & date women.

No. To a severely mentally retarded person, for example a congenital idiot and to those suffering from diseases such as:  
\- Polymalformative Syndromes (S.Prader Willy, S. Sotos, S. Cornelia de Lange, Lissencephalia, etc.)  
\- Neurocutaneous syndromes (Tuberous Sclerosis, M. Recklinghausen, etc.)  
\- Fetal encephalitis (T.O.R.C.H.)

What you wrote is not at all obvious. It is not obvious to a subject which it is the ""least intelligent"" either implicitly or explicitly.

""When would you say life starts, then?""

the question is much more complicated than that, if I gave you a truthful but philosophical definition 9 out of 10 cases you wouldn't understand and you would think I'm crazy.  
  
First of all, you just need to know that life doesn't begin at conception because a fertilized egg has a very low chance of sticking, going up the uterus, in most cases the fertilized eggs are expelled during menstruation. This alone proves, that according to your ""logic"" any female who is sexually active and menstruating is a serial killer. Because every single fertilized egg has the ability to develop into a baby within 9 months.

furthermore early miscarriages are incredibly common ‚Äî many women miscarry before they even realize they are pregnant ‚Äî and most are due to nothing more than a chromosomal mixup. As Dr. Bryan Cowan, chair of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson explained to Parenting, ""Mismatched chromosomes account for at least 60 percent of miscarriages.""

Complicating matters further though is that significant fetal abnormalities or other complications don't always result in miscarriage. In these cases, termination is often the medically-advised option, particularly when the mother's health is affected (aka someone who is definitely a human being with a right to her own body). But a definition of life beginning at conception can change what would otherwise be considered the best medical option, as the fetus would ultimately have to be carried to term, regardless of the outcome.

if these social and medical reasons are not enough for you; on to the philosophical part:

Life in itself remains undefined by modern science. It is said to be a characteristic that distinguishes objects that have signaling and self-sustaining processes including the capacity for growth, reproduction, etc., from those that do not, either because such functions have ceased (death), or else because they lack such functions and are classified as inanimate.  
  
life in its concrete manifestations is the legitimate result and consequence of chemical affinity; as to life in its abstract sense, life pure and simple ‚Äî well, scientists know no more of it today, than they knew in the incipient stage of occidental medicine.  
  
Spirit, life and matter, are not natural principles existing independently of each other, but the effects of combinations produced by eternal motion in Space.  
  
If you get to the root of the problem, you notice how the only true discriminant is the implied motion of a body. even atoms move, in their plane of expression they are just another way of life. rigidly divided life in the contemporary conception is totally misleading. universal motion itself is life as any real occultist and mystic from the beginning of time until now will tell you. There is no beginning to life because it is all-pervading and prior to this single universe, being in its essence the motion that brings the universes into being.

and who said otherwise?

this sentence of yours is not an argument.

""Human life starts somewhere.""

did you know that there have been in the past and there are still cases of children born with animal characteristics both in terms of physicality and mental and cognitive abilities?

the line of demarcation between human life, semi-human life, vegetable life, semi-animal life and semi-vegetable life together is a distinction that is rightly convenient for scientific classifications, but the facts are more complicated than that.

There are cases of beings with chromosomes partially hybridized with various animals without artificial genomic manipulation.

""I know that it starts somewhere because it ends somewhere.""

No. You have no proof of this. why do you assume that your idea corresponds to reality? this is purely nihilistic conditioning. Physics scientists claim that matter observable by all their means should correspond to about 4% of the manifest energies in expression, and you claim to know when an energy animating a body ends or not?

Have you ever heard the expression of the famous chemist and scientist Lavoisier that ""Nothing is created, nothing is destroyed, everything is transformed""?

even just by following the first law of thermodynamics one infers that the transmigration of different energies from the most subtle to the grossest must find a field of expression congenial to them.

then cyclically as I said above (universal motion which is life) they will be rebalanced, with a cause-effect mechanism between them that reverberates (third law of thermodynamics) in the subsequent expressions of form.

""Where it starts cannot be subjective""

taking into account that sensory objectivity is literally the set of subjectivities that perceive in a similar way to each other in some aspects... the answer is obvious.

""I will place the marker at the earliest point that it can possibly begin. That is conception.""

and by doing so you make every sexually active and menstruating female a serial killer as I explained in the previous comment. But other than that your definition is completely arbitrary and it's not like you say ""the earliest point that it can possibly begin."" seeing and considering that for example that our body is formed at the molecular level of carbon (and the molecules have magnetic impulses, they move incessantly and are susceptible to external and internal chemical forces that influence them and these atoms react to those as well) why not consider the atoms of carbon, living entities? none of us could physically live without them right? so what's stopping you from banning coal plants? since they are literally burning the blocks of our physical life?

father does not want, mom keeps child, father gotta pay half of child expenses.(and i mean the bio father not necessarily the husband, cause that's some complicated shit going on.)

mom, dad both don't want child, let child be adopted by parents who want to, and bio mom and dad still has to pay child expenses, adopted parents choose to either put it in child's bank account or for the child's college fund.

How on earth did you watch that video and thing ""feminists!""? That is just what kids/youth in general do. They try to impress each other. Do stupid shit. So that's what I think of the people in the video. They're stupid kids doing stupid shit. It have happened since time immemorial.

What strikes me in a bunch of the comments on this sub is how much everyone seem to know about the intentions and emotions of other people. How do you know that they are feminists to impress women? How do you know that they don't give a fuck? What do you know about how much dignity they feel they have, or that they feel morally superior? Some probably do those things, and many don't. My point is that saying these things isn't a critique of feminism, it's just talking shit about other people based of your own subjective impression of what feminists are like.

I'm a guy who's open to opinions, and will listen to reasonable debate. But the number of delusional people in this sub is staggering. People here know that there's \_a lot\_ of feminists, right? Both men and women. And that the vast majority just want gender equality and freedom for everyone? That most aren't aggressive bully simps who have never touched a women? The average, run of the mill feminist guy is a regulare dude. It can be your boss, your team mate, the guy at the store.

Creating a feminist monster who's irrational, aggressive and violoent doesn't serve any purpose. Because then you'll be shadow boxing. Fighting a monster that only really exist in your own head.

Final point, related to all of this, is something wise someone thought me many years ago: Always assume that your opponent means well. That they are genuine. Even though you find it immoral or disagree vastly. Assume that the feminists have good intentions and are genuine about their belief in feminism. If you do that, you might be able to engage and debate and change minds. If you create them as monsters who's irrational the only place you'll get is screaming in the eccochamber of this sub.

First of all, I didnt say that these men were feminists (though it would not surprise me in the slightest), you just wanted to see why I hate them and this is why, because they are SIMILAR to these people at what they do. 


Also, we know simps try to do this for several reasons. When you talk with some of these feminist men, they are extremely annoying with feminism, they are really obssesed with it, and they see sexism everywhere. But any other kind of discriminization is not important for lots of them at all, they dont fight for racism, men discriminization, environmental issues or women being treatedly awful in other countries. You just see these people (who are usually perverts) doing stupid things feminists say as if they were possesed trying to change stupidities.


On top of that, some of these feminists complain about these people being sex-beggers or asking for nudes,  they treat women as their fleshlight (or thats their wish lol). I have seen VERY cringy feminists men who made me feel ashamed of my own gender. Why do you think they are trying so hard to get only feminists' attention then?


And they are not irrational, they have a purpose, which is pathetic and laughable, but still a purpose. Feminist women are despicable in the majority of cases as well, but at least they have more reasons to do so; they have clear ideas and their purpose is a lot more understandable (superiority). You can talk with them oftenly.


And it is clear to see that simps view themselves as morally superior as they treat people who dont agree with them as trash. They view themselves as social justice warriors, like heroes who try to safe women from anyone who thinks different. Their opinion is the politically correct one.


Edit: And I forgot to mention btw; as feminism nowadays is a movement which is only looking for superiority, I dont think any normal man would be there as you said. Probably in the old feminism when it was really looking for equality. Either what I said or manipulated people.


(There is not a 100% way to proof that feminists men do it. And Im not saying that all of them are that way. However, as they try so hard to satisfy feminist women but dont care in the slightest about the real women suffering real patriarchy, or real issues in the world, it makes me think that they dont really care about it.

Feminist women are despicable in the majority of cases as well, but at least they have more reasons to do so; they have clear ideas and their purpose is a lot more understandable (superiority). You can talk with them oftenly.


And it is clear to see that simps view themselves as morally superior as they treat people who dont agree with them as trash. They view themselves as social justice warriors, like heroes who try to safe women from anyone who thinks different. Their opinion is the politically correct one.


Edit: And I forgot to mention btw; as feminism nowadays is a movement which is only looking for superiority, I dont think any normal man would be there as you said. Probably in the old feminism when it was really looking for equality. Either what I said or manipulated people.


(There is not a 100% way to proof that feminists men do it. And Im not saying that all of them are that way. However, as they try so hard to satisfy feminist women but dont care in the slightest about the real women suffering real patriarchy, or real issues in the world, it makes me think that they dont really care about it. They are just pretending).",,,

Again, how do you know this? This is just an assumtion you're pulling out of your ass. You are angry at a strawman. My impression and experience is that feminism most often is a part of a wider attention to or concern about oppression of different kinds. 

The part about sex and treating them as fleshlights is also an assumption, and until you present evidence that feminist men objectify women more than non-feminists do, it remains an assumption. 

And I still disagree with you about feminism today. In most cases, as in media, organizations, social science etc., feminism is not about superiority but equality. I get that many in this sub feel that men's issues are not taken seriously, and I agree with that, but pretending that all women's issues are solved and that we ""have"" equality is just absurde. Most feminists I have met are concerned with these issues, not with superiority and crushing men. That is a subsection of very radical feminists who do not represent the majority. 

One final thing I wanna bring up is that you may wanna concider that given your own very anti-feminist stand and harsh vocabulary about them, this might lead you to attract a certain kind of people to respond to you. I am not saying it is your fault, but there is a generally awknowledged truism that we tend to defend ourself when we feel attacked. This interplay between you and the feminists you encounter might seem more harsh because you both feel attacked by each other and feel like you have to defend yourself. So, maybe feminist in general aren't angry and impossible to discuss with, they just are so with people who ""attack"" them and their beliefes (by for instant calling them perverts, vermin, pathetic etc.).

I'll tackle why she is wrong for explaining her view in such a manner.

if you explain anything that way, it diminishes the entire point. 
let's talk about the male abs- ""it's just a wall of muscle"" ok, but it's still something sexualized and desired. even things like male hands, facial hair and veins are desirable to women. But they can be described as plainly just a part of the body like anything else.

Now onto the sticky part- why I do understand.
I have seen comments, and feminists can reply to all of these with something to say and it wouldn't necessary be wrong even backed with science.
""Women's boobs have sex receptors/sensitive endogenous zones"" have you ever stimulated a man's nipples? they're also sensitive- and can be stimulated in sex. And men can technically lactate. Meaning our anatomy isn't too different which is why they think and believe they can walk around topless. men's chests (muscles abs) shirtless is lusted over. 

Women feeding their children aren't for men nor is it meant to be arousing. Maybe it's because it shows she is fertile? I don't know. But I don't agree women should walk around shirtless. Even if it's a societal construct- it's in their own interest to cover up, especially since we are targets of assaults and because of society in why they should in that case. And throughout history it's hard to undo years of conservative beliefs about our bodies, we had to cover ankles for Pete sake lol! 

When women breast feed in public it annoys me because it's an intimate moment between a mother and child and having to witness it is... uncomfortable. it's like PDA to me- even if not intended to arouse. And it would make me uncomfortable if I saw a woman walking around shirtless. I do wonder if it's really down to society as like I said we had once had to cover our ankles and we even put blush on our knee caps to entice men which eventually got unbanned. Should men cover their nipples?

>	'Kate wasn't so attractive that she would alienate the female audience.' He kept saying it everywhere we went, and we went to a lot of places.""

I think that is a valid reason to hire someone in a role if the role is more of a vehicle for the viewer to put themselves in. For example, Katniss Everdeen in Hunger Games was very much a ‚Äúvehicle‚Äù for the viewer, as was Bella in Twilight. That's why they both had mostly bland personalities and more ‚Äúplain‚Äù looks (not that the actresses are plain looking, I think they were purposefully made to look more plain than they are IRL). I think it's true that too attractive of a female lead for these ‚Äúviewer vehicle‚Äù roles makes it harder for women to see themselves in it.

On the other hand, I think men see those ‚Äúvehicle‚Äù roles differently. I think men prefer a character vehicle that they *wish* they were, not something they already can see themselves as. For example, Tyler Durden or 007. But we do also get the occasional ‚Äúplain‚Äù character too, like Neo in The Matrix (I think he is damn near the very definition of a character vehicle).

However, back to the quote‚Ä¶while being ‚Äúnot alienating-ly attractive‚Äù is a valid reason to cast someone in one of these roles, I could see how insulting it could be to be told that directly.

Also, do they have any idea how many jobs *normal people* have to take that we don't like and feel are demeaning until we can get a well paid job we like?? A LOT! 

Nobody dreams of being a retail restocker as a child, but you have to start somewhere! Sure we all complain about shitty job experiences, but don't act like you're standing up for some righteous cause when you talk about a one-dimensional TV role you took, as if its more demeaning or dehumanizing work than being a busboy or a sign-flipper at the corner of an intersection. You're not some martyr for taking shit acting roles. 

>	The first shot is going to be‚Ä¶You're going to think it's, like, yellow lines down a road, and you pull back, and you realize it's the stitching, because the denim is so tight on your ass it's going to look like tarmac.' I was like, 'Oh, I don't think we're going to go down this road together.'""

Ok goddamn, that one is pretty egregious. I don't think a woman should be shamed if she is totally fine with that idea, but if she's not then I think it's a pretty valid reason to walk away! Once again we return to‚Ä¶don't take the role if you don't like it, or deal with the shit job to move up the ladder like every NORMAL PERSON has to!

>	'Kate wasn't so attractive that she would alienate the female audience.' He kept saying it everywhere we went, and we went to a lot of places.""

I think that is a valid reason to hire someone in a role if the role is more of a vehicle for the viewer to put themselves in. For example, Katniss Everdeen in Hunger Games was very much a ‚Äúvehicle‚Äù for the viewer, as was Bella in Twilight. That's why they both had mostly bland personalities and more ‚Äúplain‚Äù looks (not that the actresses are plain looking, I think they were purposefully made to look more plain than they are IRL). I think it's true that too attractive of a female lead for these ‚Äúviewer vehicle‚Äù roles makes it harder for women to see themselves in it.

On the other hand, I think men see those ‚Äúvehicle‚Äù roles differently. I think men prefer a character vehicle that they *wish* they were, not something they already can see themselves as. For example, Tyler Durden or 007. But we do also get the occasional ‚Äúplain‚Äù character too, like Neo in The Matrix (I think he is damn near the very definition of a character vehicle).

However, back to the quote‚Ä¶while being ‚Äúnot alienating-ly attractive‚Äù is a valid reason to cast someone in one of these roles, I could see how insulting it could be to be told that directly. 

Tl;dr: Some valid opinions in the article but overall, privileged rich people complaining about rich people things. Go back to your country clubs where you belong.",,,

It is my fault that I ate something given to me by a stranger. As far as I am concerned you weren't drugged, got drunk, fucked another dude, and then started making excuses. I don't believe in blackout shit, I've gotten blitzed and have plenty of nights I can't remember, but I've never gotten drunk and 'lost control', no matter how drunk I have been I always am able to think and control myself and do what I want, sans inhibition lol. Just because you don't remember what happened doesn't mean you didn't make that choice. It was still you that fucked the dude, cheated on your bf, and now playing victim. 

I hate this liquor bs, so many innocent men get their entire life ruined and even end up in jail because girls like this don't want to admit they are trash people.",,,

So, I'd be more inclined to believe she just regular blacked out instead of being drugged. Which, correct me if this is wrong, is a time when a person has very low inhibitions and a lower intelligence generally.

* **Sally Miller Gearhart**

* In her early career, Gearhart took part in a series of seminars at San Francisco State University, where feminist scholars were critically discussing issues of rape, slavery, and the possibility of nuclear annihilation. Gearhart outlines a three-step proposal for female-led social change from her essay, ""The Future‚Äì-If There Is One‚Äì-is Female"":

* I) Every culture must begin to affirm a female future.
* II) Species responsibility must be returned to women in every culture.
* III) The proportion of men must be reduced to and maintained at approximately 10% of the human race.

* Gearhart does not base this radical proposal on the idea that men are innately violent or oppressive, but rather on the ""real danger is in the phenomenon of male-bonding, that commitment of groups of men to each other whether in an army, a gang, a service club, a lodge, a monastic order, a corporation, or a competitive sport."" Gearhart identifies the self-perpetuating, male-exclusive reinforcement of power within these groups as corrosive to female-led social change. Thus, if ""men were reduced in number, the threat would not be so great and the placement of species responsibility with the female would be assured."" Gearhart, a dedicated pacifist, recognized that this kind of change could not be achieved through mass violence. On the critical question of how women could achieve this, Gearhart argues that it is by women's own capacity for reproduction that the ratio of men to women can be changed though the technologies of cloning or ovular merging, both of which would only produce female births. She argues that as women take advantage of these reproductive technologies, the sex ratio would change over generations.^[14]

* Daphune Patal in her book Heterophobia: Sexual Harassment and the Future of Feminism summarizes Gearhart's essay as, ""The future must be in female hands, women alone must control the reproduction of species; and only 10% of the population should be allowed to be male"".^[15]

* Mary Daly supported Gearhart's proposals, stating: ""I think it's not a bad idea at all. If life is to survive on this planet, there must be a decontamination of the Earth. I think this will be accompanied by an evolutionary process that will result in a drastic reduction of the population of males.""^[16]",t3_z75wvp,"* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Miller_Gearhart

iycujpv,t1_iy8l3lp,"Yeah man. These people are generally just idiotic. There's a reason we don't freeze blood in blood banks...nor do we freeze organs. In room temperature, any element of your body goes bad in less than a week (except hair and nails). You keep it in low temperatures (hematic seals) to manage enzymatic action, and keep it from depleting the energy it has. Then you bring it up to body temps, and install it within hours.

Sperms are among the most sensitive and energy intensive cells. Which is why Somalis use hot towels as a temporary male contraceptive (varying results). If you freeze semen, you will damage all the sperm cells.

So if all men disappeared, all women would have less than three weeks on the last sperm bank deposit. Also, artificial insemination rarely works. So even less time.

So if we run the simulation. Immediately, humanity has lost the people who run global logistics, and therefore dissemination process is already halted. So essentially over 2 billion women will have no access to it. Now going by the numbers, they'll have a 40% chance to successfully inseminate those that will have access (assuming there's enough professionals to do it). Then you run into natural pops. Of the 40%, less than half will have male children, and about 60% will carry them to term. Then 80% will make it to adulthood, and based on feminist ideology...most of them will likely commit suicide just to get away from these women.

We haven't talked about riots from those who won't have access to the sperm. The inevitable wars, as some populations will have more boys born than others. The problems of testicular dysfunction (very few women know how a male body works). There will be food shortages, nuclear meltdown...just absolute pandemonium. Why? Because regardless of what you read, women are more prone to violence than men are. Chaos is more likely to brew where there are women...than where there are men.

Let's just say, that anyone who thinks a world of women will survive more than 10 years, is nuts. The species is literally based on the existence of men. Sure, we need women too...but not as much.

A society of pure men already exists, in multiple places across the world, men have experimented with living without women..for multiple centuries. Side from the population decline, there's not much else a lack of women would do. Sure, we'd rapidly reduce in population...but remember, an ovum is a somatic cell...technically any cell with a nucleus can be hacked to work as an ovum. You can even use those of great apes, as African ancestors did with Neaderthals. Success would be very limited, but still possible over time...with some serious work in gene editing. And then you'd only need one viable female..clone it, and harvest ova. Probably build gestation pods too, but again...other primates can serve as surrogate mothers if that proves impossible. Thus eventually, we'd have a human-like population. Now, the chances of this working are very low. The same societal problems a pure female society would have, would also be present in a pure male society...albeit at lower levels.

So yeah; there's no future that's female. Unless it's vulcan females coming to earth for some mating raid...then yeah, we are fucked and fucking.",t3_z75wvp,"Yeah man.

Now going by the numbers, they'll have a 40% chance to successfully inseminate those that will have access (assuming there's enough professionals to do it). Then you run into natural pops. Of the 40%, less than half will have male children, and about 60% will carry them to term. Then 80% will make it to adulthood, and based on feminist ideology...most of them will likely commit suicide just to get away from these women.

We haven't talked about riots from those who won't have access to the sperm. The inevitable wars, as some populations will have more boys born than others. The problems of testicular dysfunction (very few women know how a male body works). There will be food shortages, nuclear meltdown...just absolute pandemonium. Why? Because regardless of what you read, women are more prone to violence than men are. Chaos is more likely to brew where there are women...than where there are men.

Let's just say, that anyone who thinks a world of women will survive more than 10 years, is nuts. The species is literally based on the existence of men. Sure, we need women too...but not as much.

A society of pure men already exists, in multiple places across the world, men have experimented with living without women..for multiple centuries. Side from the population decline, there's not much else a lack of women would do. Sure, we'd rapidly reduce in population...but remember, an ovum is a somatic cell...technically any cell with a nucleus can be hacked to work as an ovum. You can even use those of great apes, as African ancestors did with Neaderthals. Success would be very limited, but still possible over time...with some serious work in gene editing. And then you'd only need one viable female..clone it, and harvest ova. Probably build gestation pods too, but again...other primates can serve as surrogate mothers if that proves impossible. Thus eventually, we'd have a human-like population. Now, the chances of this working are very low. The same societal problems a pure female society would have, would also be present in a pure male society...albeit at lower levels.

So yeah; there's no future that's female. Unless it's vulcan females coming to earth for some mating raid...then yeah, we are fucked and fucking.",,,

1st wave feminists: Two examples of first wave feminists demanding and getting men's rights without men's responsibilities. Two of them actively involve zero sum situations such as income and property rights, or custody rights to children, and in both cases feminists managed to arrange things such that women got all the rights while men were still burdened with all the responsibility: 

1)Won the right for married women to own their own property and income, and hold it separate from their husband's control. Yet maintained the legal entitlement of married women to be supported financially by their husband. Their entitlement to their husbands support even extended to the tax burden on their property and income--property and income their husbands were legally prohibited from touching. There were men sent to prison in the UK for tax evasion for being unable to pay the taxes owing on the property/income of their wealthier wives. One suffragette, Dr. Elizabeth Wilks even refused (as was her right under the law) to provide her husband with the necessary documentation so he could calculate the taxes, and given that he was a schoolteacher and responsible for paying for everything else, he couldn't have afforded to pay it regardless. While he was in prison, she urged other suffragettes to do what she had. He was released from prison on humanitarian grounds due to his failing health, and died a few months later. 

2) Won default mother custody of young children upon divorce or separation thanks to the tender years doctrine. Previously, the assumption was of paternal custody since the father was solely burdened with financial responsibility for their care. Of course, it was only custody that was changed, financial responsibility still fell 100% to the father to maintain the household of his minor children.",t3_z8ppgu,"Fuckoff555 didn't represent this poorly.

It is important to bear in mind that a common practice employed by ideologies like feminism that wish to resort to violence as a means to impose change is to divide themselves into two or more fragments, one that relies entirely on violence and hate, whilst the others rely entirely on politics. They are all connected, but they claim not to be. This way when the need for violence comes to an end or the violent group is attacked and destroyed the other groups remain intact. You can find a great example of a successful implementation of this tactic in Northern Ireland's Sinn Fein. They had a political wing which called itself Sinn Fein and an armed, violent, radical, and hate-filled wing, which called itself the IRA. The armed wing became a target for imprisonment and death at the hands of the British, but this did not at all drown out the voice of Sinn Fein, which still had its political wing intact, which the British could not touch because officially the two groups were unrelated.

The Black Panthers were a group of amateurs that acted as one body both political and violent. The American Government targeted all of the leaders and followers of the Black Panthers with violence and imprisonment. They were all killed and/or imprisoned, therefore, bringing the Black Panther movement to an end.

Feminism unlike the Black Panthers has successfully employed the Sinn Fein/IRA tactic. It is divided into many groups, radical and mainstream to name but two that all claim to be disconnected from each other and unrelated when they are all highly connected.
